%Goal: set the stage: why collider searches are needed and interesting. 

%- we know there is DM [review] and it is one of the best motivated observations of BSM physics
%-- relic
%- there are other searches and they haven't found anything yet, or perhaps they have (hints of signals), but nothing conclusive
%- at the LHC we have a tool that has been used to make discoveries of all SM particles so far
%- this article is about what we can learn, keeping in mind that the main running version of that tool we have is the LHC


Dark matter (DM) is perhaps the most persuasive experimental evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics~\cite{Bertone:2016nfn}. 
If DM is indeed a particle~\cite{Steigman:1979kw}, it has gravitational interactions with normal matter.
It may have other, non-gravitational interactions, but these are relatively rare---dark matter is dark and has no electromagnetic charge.
It is also stable, or at least it decays with a lifetime comparable to that of the universe.
Finally, there is {\it a lot} of DM, about five times the standard matter (SM) described by the Standard Model of particle physics, with plenty of room to exceed the SM in its complexity.
The current abundance of dark matter in the universe, derived from measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background~\cite{Ade:2015xua}, is one of the few quantitative measures of DM, or indeed of any physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The main consequences of cosmological observations for particle dark matter are listed in the Sidebar.

The field of particle physics is increasingly keen to understand what Dark Matter (DM) is, if it is indeed a particle. 
Some experiments, termed Direct Detection (DD) experiments, look for galactic DM colliding with underground targets made of Standard Model matter (SM)~\cite{0954-3899-43-1-013001}.
Others, termed Indirect Detection (ID) experiments, search for the products of annihilating dark matter concentrated within the gravitational potential wells of the Milky Way and elsewhere~\cite{Gaskins:2016cha}.
None of these experiments has yet found conclusive evidence of DM.
If the only interaction between DM and SM matter is gravitational, experiments will never see it.
Yet the search for particle DM started relatively recently, and plenty of room for optimism remains.

Colliders, one of the most successful tools of particle physics, have revealed much about SM matter.
This review will sketch how colliders contribute to the search for DM, focusing on the highest-energy collider currently in operation, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
Absent hints for the character of DM-SM interactions, it emphasizes what could be observed in the near future, the main experimental challenges presented, and how collider searches fit into the broader field.
Finally, it underlines a few areas to watch for the future LHC program.

%Define Standard Model (SM), Dark Matter (DM). There is also an "acronym" section we could use. 
%Need to decide whether Dark Matter or dark matter.

%Most recent reviews of DD and ID (in absence of anything better?)
%\cite{DMDD_NaturePhysics}
%\cite{DMID_NaturePhysics}
%I prefer these ones also because they have arXivs but they are older , . There is also a VERY old AR: \cite{doi:10.1146/annurev.nucl.54.070103.181244}


%Throughout this review, we will consider the relic density as a rough order-of-magnitude guide for our selection of models and results, rather than as an exact constraint. Most of the models considered that satisfy the relic density only consider a single particle. The DM sector may be much more complex than a single particle with a limited number of interactions. Nevertheless, if these simple examples dominate over others

%these simple examples may emerge in the searches at the early stages of the LHC  particles  
%Make point that we see simple things first (why simplified models is a good assumption).
