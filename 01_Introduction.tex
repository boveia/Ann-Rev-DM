Define Standard Model (SM), Dark Matter (DM). There is also an "acronym" section we could use. 
Need to decide whether Dark Matter or dark matter.

Most recent reviews of DD and ID (in absence of anything better?)
\cite{DMDD_NaturePhysics}
\cite{DMID_NaturePhysics}
I prefer these ones also because they have arXivs but they are older \cite{Gaskins:2016cha}, \cite{0954-3899-43-1-013001}. There is also a VERY old AR: \cite{doi:10.1146/annurev.nucl.54.070103.181244}
