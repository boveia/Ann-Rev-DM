%Throughout this review, we will consider the relic density as a rough order-of-magnitude guide for our selection of models and results, rather than as an exact constraint. Most of the models considered that satisfy the relic density only consider a single particle. The DM sector may be much more complex than a single particle with a limited number of interaactions. Nevertheless, if these simple examples dominate over others.  

%these simple examples may emerge in the searches at the early stages of the LHC  particles  

In this chapter, we will link the observations on DM to its particle properties. We then enumerate the possible reactions of DM at the LHC within certain grounding assumptions, building from simple to more complex models in terms of particle content. 

\subsection{Observations on DM as a guide for its particle properties}
\label{sec:DMObservations}

The observations mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:intro} require the dark matter particle to be stable on a cosmological timescale. This has important consequences for the prediction and observation of dark matter reactions at colliders. 

Firstly, a simple theoretical way to stabilize DM is the introduction
of a global $Z_2$ symmetry, as in Ref.~\cite{Batell:2010bp}. A realization of this
symmetry can be found in R-parity in the MSSM. %citation?
Under this symmetry, the parity of the DM particle is odd, while the parity of SM particles is even. 
$Z_2$-parity is multiplicative and conserved: this 
%is Z_2 parity a thing? I don't want to have it confused with the global SM parity
implies that an odd-parity DM particle (charge -1) cannot decay into any 
lighter even-parity SM particles (charge +1) and it is therefore stable. 
Additionally, DM particles will be produced in pairs from the decay of other particles
that are charged under the same gauge group as the SM. 

A simplified diagram of an s-channel process at colliders satisfying $Z_2$ symmetry is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sChannel}. If the particle mediating the SM-DM interaction is a SM particle, no additional particles beyond the DM need to be invoked, leading to the simplest DM production mode at the LHC. The only theoretically viable SM portal particles within the grounding assumptions of this revew are the Z and the Higgs bosons, described in Section~\ref{sec:HZPortalModels}.

\end{marginnote}

%TODO: add sidebar figure of s-channel. 
%this will become useful when we talk about s-channel mediators. maybe also make a point
%for the t-channel mediator?

Secondly, dark matter particles are invisible to detectors. 
However, the rest of the event is not: one can observe DM particles
produced in the event and escaping the detector 
due to their missing momentum in the transverse plane, if they recoil against one or 
more visible SM particles. 

%I don't like how this is linking up. 

%shared context: many possible new physics searches at the LHC
%problem: can't do them all
%solution: strong theoretical motivation, as well as observability
%exposition: particular case of DM

Collider experiments have a nearly unlimited choice of theoretically
motivated DM targets to search for. 
Theoretical arguments alone are not sufficient for a DM model to be tested at the LHC: 
couplings to SM particles need to feature in the model and be sufficiently large
to produce new particles and observe their signatures in the detectors. 

%everyone thinks of WIMPs, how strong is strong, how weak is weak? quantitative question of coupling, depends on model. in the introduction: need to talk about DM properties. Weak enough that there is no visible EM signal (no light emission or absorption). Relate those properties to what the particle physics properties need to be. Have a model in mind: s-channel mediator between DM and SM, weakness of interaction comes from particle being heavy or coupling being small. DMF models have order=1 couplings. 

Models of particle dark matter include SM couplings to satisfy cosmological observations in the freeze-out case. These couplings need to be weak enough that there is no visible signal of DM particles, as there is no evidence for DM interacting strongly with baryonic matter, nor for its emission or absorption of light. A typical DM-SM coupling satisfying relic density is of the order of XXX. 

The only SM particle that satisfies the requirement of being sufficiently weakly interacting is the neutrino. However, neutrinos cannot make up the totality of DM as they are not sufficiently massive to explain the galaxy structures that formed in the universe. %%CITE FENG AR, BERTONE'S BOOK
The upper bound on the neutrino content of DM is YYY. 

Unlike previous accelerators that either yielded large datasets (e.g. B-factories) or high center-of-mass energy (e.g. Tevatron), the LHC gives unprecedented access to both rare processes and high scale processes at the same time, planning to collect 3/ab by 2035 reaching the design center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. For this reason, it is worth speculating whether the portal particles could be observed at the LHC for the first time. Models that include one or more very massive new particles beyond the SM in addition to the DM particle are also an LHC search target, and are described in Section~\ref{sec:BSMMediatorModels}. 

Portal models and models of simple BSM mediation are only motivated by the observation of DM. They keep the SM and the DM sectors separate, and make no claim to being a solution of other shortfalls of the SM. However, the coincidence that hierarchy problem, gauge coupling unification and DM particle nature could be solved with a single theory with observable consequences at the electroweak scale, has been one of the driving reasons to develop and consider SuperSymmetry (SUSY) as one of the main search targets for LHC searches. These models are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:SUSYModels}.

Finally, let us return on the concept of observability of the search target mentioned above. Even general purpose particle detectors may miss certain classes of phenomena, as the initial design choices privileged searches for the Higgs boson and for particles that generally decay promptly, as predicted by models discussed so far. However, there is tension when confronting data with portal models, BSM mediation models and supersymmetric models that are compatible with the standard freeze-out scenarios. This encourages us to look for other classes of models, especially those including particles with long lifetimes, as a way to shine the search lamppost beyond the classic WIMP scenario. Reaction including those particles and their connections to DM are sketched in Section~\ref{sec:LLPModels}

\section{Caveats and grounding assumptions}
\label{sec:GroundingAssumptions}

%%I suggest this part goes in the introduction, as it motivates enumeration of models in chapter 2 and comparisons in chapter 4. 
The observation of a signal of visible or invisible particles at an LHC experiment that could be identified as being generated by one of the reactions described in this chapter cannot lead to claim that DM has been discovered. This is because DM is stable on a cosmological scale, while LHC experiments are limited to the observation of particles with a lifetime that is longer than the time needed to escape the detector (i.e. DM candidate particles could still decay into other particles outside the detector and leave a signal of missing transverse energy). This is not a reason to discount searches for DM at the LHC, as such a signal would still be a groundbreaking discovery, regardless of its interpretation. This statement highlights the importance of the comparison of LHC results, where DM would be produced in the lab, with the results of complementary experiments that look for signals of DM coming from space. This comparison can only take place if the same theoretical model is used to interpret both results. This motivates the enumeration of possible models in this chapter. 

To define the scope of the reactions for invisible particles at colliders considered in this review, we make a number of grounding assumptions: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item We describe models where the DM particle interacts with SM particles, either directly or indirectly;
\item We restrict our list to models that include a $Z_2$ symmetry to stabilize DM;
\item We privilege models that respect Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV), which imposes that the flavor structure of couplings between DM and ordinary particles follows that of the SM.  %CITE?

\subsection{Higgs and Z boson portals}
\label{sec:HZPortalModels}

Even if we cannot observe DM itself at colliders, we can look for visible particles that are associated to Dark Matter. The LHC alone cannot solve the strong CP problem through observation of the axion, but it can still observe e.g. scalar resonances that appear in the theory. 

This raises the question of whether any of the SM particles could be associated to DM, for example in a similar fashion as the W and Z bosons mediate the weak interaction and produce neutrino pairs in the reaction. Models where the SM particle sector is coupled to the dark sector through an existing or a new particle are called \textit{portal models}. This kind of model leads to the most economical particle content for reactions at the LHC, as one only needs to add a neutral DM particle to the SM content if one of the SM particles is the portal particle. SM fermions cannot be portal particles under the assumption of a $Z_2$ symmetry, as they would allow the decay of DM. Photons, W bosons and gluons can't be portal particles either, as DM does not absorb nor emit light, nor it does it have electromagnetic or strong charge. The only viable SM portal particles remaining are the Z and the Higgs bosons. 

There are strong theoretical and experimental arguments to explore SM portal models at the LHC. 
%Theoretical
Processes involving mediators at the electroweak scale are among the first to be investigated, in DM theories that predict new weakly interacting particles. This kind of portals are also present in a number of other theories~\ref{Arcadi:2014lta}. 
%Experimental 
However, it is only the recent generations of collider and direct detection experiments that have started being able to probe the range of small couplings and relatively large scales required to observe this kind of models. 

The \textbf{Z portal} model, where the DM particle has vector and axial vector interactions with a Z boson, is a minimal extension of the SM as it only requires a single new particle to be added to the SM particle content. In $SU(2)_L \ctimes U(1)$ extensions of the SM, the axial and vector couplings of the Z boson to DM are generally required to be of the same order. If no other couplings are present, this model is not $SU(2)xU(1)$ invariant, unless couplings to the DM to the Higgs boson are added as well~\cite{Kahlhoefer:2015bea}. 
%The couplings between the Z and the DM can be vector, axial or mixed. 
In the minimal case where the couplings do not depend on the Lorentz structure of the interaction, 
%what I want to say: In general they are excluded in their minimal version because of their strong vectorial coupling necessary to respect relic abundance bounds.
large couplings are required for this model to satisfy the relic density. 
In the case of equal vector and axial couplings, this model is heavily constrained by LEP and direct detection experiments (see e.g. Refs.~\cite{Arcadi:2014lta,Escudero:2016gzx}). This model can still be viable wherever no relations between the vector and axial couplings are present. A review of Z portal models with different couplings can be found in Ref.~\cite{Arcadi:2014lta}. 
%Does one require a certain kind of couplings for symmetries? 
%Arcadi says: 
%In all these extensions, the axial coupling Aχ (see eq.(1)) of the Z boson to the dark matter is naturally of the order of magnitude of its vectorial coupling Vχ. The deep reason is that in a framework of SU(2)L × U(1) breaking the original SU(2)L condition (Vχ = Aχ) is only mildly modified by the dynamic of the breaking. 
%Maybe link this to the choices for the Z' model later on? 

The discovery of a SM-like Higgs boson~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012xdj} has sparked theoretical and experimental interest in \textbf{Higgs portal} models, where DM particles can interact with SM particles only through the Higgs boson (see e.g. Refs.~\cite{Patt:2006fw,Englert:2011yb,Djouadi:2011aa}). In Higgs portal models, DM couples to the SM operator connecting two Higgs fields. This operator is dominant in the SM. This process is renormalizable and leads to a UV-complete, minimal theory in the case of scalar and vector DM, while a self-consistent theory requires the presence of further particles mediating the interaction in the case of fermion DM~\cite{Freitas:2015hsa}. 



Higgs-sector and Z′ interactions between the hidden sector
and the SM states are special in that they involve gauge-invariant operators of dimension
dO ≤ 4, and thus can be induced by physics at arbitrarily high scales with unsuppressed
couplings. 


operator connecting the Higgs and DM particle fields are the lowest-dimension renormalizable operator in the case of scalar and vector DM, and if present could dominate the interactions

could therefore have a higher cross-section

while for Dirac DM 



 Since H†H is the lowest-dimensional Lorentz- and gauge-invariant operator in the SM, such Higgs portal couplings to DM could dominate the interactions between the visible sector and the dark sector 

The properties of the Higgs boson are modified in the presence of decays to invisible particles. Precision measurements of the Higgs width and couplings offer a probe for these models that complements direct searches for the invisible particles, as described in the next chapter. 


Higgs portal models are still viable near the Higgs pole, if the DM mass is about half the Higgs mass. Maybe explain why. 

%Arcadi
%However, the last LUX results[11], combined with the invisi- ble width of the Higgs excluded the Higgs-portal scenario for dark matter mass below 200 GeV [2].
