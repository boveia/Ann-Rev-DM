\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{sec:intro}

Dark matter (DM) is perhaps the most persuasive experimental
evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM)\ of particle
physics~\cite{Bertone:2004pz}. If DM is indeed a
particle~\cite{Steigman:1979kw}, it has gravitational interactions
with normal matter. It may also have other, nongravitational
interactions, but these are relatively rare---DM is dark
and has no electromagnetic charge. It is also stable, or at least
\hl{it decays with a lifetime comparable to that of the Universe}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Please add a reference for this important statement**]}}.
Finally, there is a great deal of DM---about five times the \hl{standard
matter} \textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: To avoid confusion, we've retained ``SM'' as the abbreviation for ``Standard Model'' and kept ``SM matter'' where used below, or spelled out ``standard matter''. Please check that the acronym has been applied correctly throughout**]}}described by the SM---with plenty of room to exceed standard matter in its complexity. The
current abundance of DM in the Universe, derived from
measurements of the cosmic microwave
background~\cite{Ade:2015xua}, is one of the few quantitative
measures of DM, or indeed of any BSM physics. The main consequences of cosmological observations for
particle DM are described in the sidebar titled Particle Properties of Dark Matter.

\begin{textbox}
\section{PARTICLE PROPERTIES OF DARK MATTER}

\noindent \textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: OK\ to number these two properties, since they are not preceded by a regular paragraph of text?**]}}Stability: If DM is a particle, it does not seem to decay.
Conservation laws, such as \textit{R} parity in supersymmetry (SUSY) or $Z_2$ symmetry, can prevent the DM particle from decaying into any
lighter even-parity SM particle. Additionally, pairs of DM
particles can be produced by the decay of other particles, charged
under the same gauge group as the SM, or singly if the
parent is a color triplet.

Darkness: DM particles are effectively invisible to
traditional collider experiments made of ordinary matter. However,
the rest of the event is not. Invisible particles can be
accompanied by one or more visible recoiling particles, leading to
missing momentum in the transverse plane, whose magnitude is
termed \MET. This is one of the main signatures of DM at
colliders.
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Please note that this sidebar will not appear above the table of contents, as it does in your original submission**]}}\end{textbox}

The field of particle physics is increasingly keen to understand
what DM is, if it is indeed a particle. Some
experiments, termed \MakeLowercase{Direct Detection} (DD) experiments, look for
galactic DM colliding with underground targets made of SM matter~\cite{0954-3899-43-1-013001}. Others, termed
\MakeLowercase{Indirect Detection} (ID) experiments, search for the products of
annihilating DM concentrated within the gravitational
potential wells of the Milky Way and
elsewhere~\cite{Gaskins:2016cha}. As yet, none of these experiments have
found conclusive evidence of DM. If the only interaction
between DM and SM matter is gravitational, \hl{experiments will never
observe it}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: The statement that something will not happen is too strong. Who knows...  maybe gravitational waves from dark matter collisions will be observed in 10 years? Please use one of the following: ``...experiments will potentially never observe it.'' or ``...experiments will probably never observe it directly.''
**]}}. Nevertheless, the search for particle DM started relatively
recently, and plenty of room for optimism remains.

Colliders, among the most successful tools of particle physics,
have revealed much about SM matter. This review describes how
colliders contribute to the search for DM, focusing on the
highest-energy collider currently in operation, the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC)\ at CERN.\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: This would be a good place to introduce the experiments that yield the results (ATLAS, CMS, LHCb) and add references**]}} In the absence of any hints as to the character of DM--SM
matter interactions, this review emphasizes what could be observed in the near
future, presents the main experimental challenges, and discusses how
collider searches fit into the broader field. Finally, it
highlights a few areas to watch for the future LHC program.

\section{REACTIONS FOR INVISIBLE-PARTICLE SEARCHES AT THE LHC}\label{sec:02_Reactions}

DM produced at colliders would register just as neutrinos do,
\hl{which is to say not at all}.\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Please revise this colloquialism to refer to the escaping particle, etc., but not ``not at all''**]}} In this section, we describe DM
production from a pragmatic, collider physicist's perspective,
focusing on a selection of simple models with distinct and
testable LHC signatures.\footnote{For other perspectives, see the
\hl{Reference Material}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Meaning Literature\ Cited?\ OK\ to move footnote into the text and rephrase as ``Other perspectives can be found in Literature Cited''?**]}}.} Moreover, we use the term {invisible
particles} (rather than DM)\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Please note that italics and boldface used for emphasis or to introduce key terms has been removed per house style**]}} when emphasizing that detecting such
particles need not be a discovery of DM.\footnote{For example,
{\IP}s may decay after leaving the detector, a decay that is
essentially prompt on cosmological timescales.}

The body of DM model literature can be divided into two extremes.
Fully realized, self-consistent models such as supersymmetry (SUSY) provide
specific features that can be exploited for narrowly targeted
searches, while simplified models with a few components can
capture broad collider signatures of classes of models, serving as
benchmarks for more general but less optimal searches. Key to both
are the determinative details of the interactions between DM
and SM matter, rather than the DM itself.

To restrict the scope of this review,
we (\textit{a}) describe only models where the DM interacts with SM hadrons, \hl{either directly or effectively}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Unclear.  Even if it's a loop-induced interaction, there has to be a direct coupling between DM and SM matter particles.  If the point was to draw a distinction on SM ``hadrons", then pls expand or emphasize this point**]}}; (\textit{b}) privilege models that include $Z_2$ symmetry to stabilize DM; (\textit{c}) emphasize models connecting to a thermal, frozen-out relic [others, based on alternate cosmological histories (e.g.,
freeze-in), also have interesting LHC
signatures~\cite{Bernal:2017kxu}]; and (\textit{d}) emphasize models employed for early LHC \hl{Run 2 searches},\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: This hasn't been defined yet; I suggest moving the margin term below to here**]}} in which
the DM is a Dirac fermion, and the model mimics the pattern of
flavor violation found in the SM, namely minimal flavor violation
(MFV)~\cite{DAmbrosio:2002vsn}. Departures from these assumptions are discussed in~Reference \citen{Abercrombie:2015wmb}.

\subsection{Higgs and {\bf \it{Z}} Boson Portals}\label{sec:HZPortalModels}

By extending the SM with a single DM particle and nothing else, one
may arrive at portal models where the \textit{Z} or Higgs boson mediates
the DM--SM matter interaction. This is an example of a {mediator}, a dark sector particle that governs the DM--SM
matter interaction. While the {\textit{Z} portal} is perhaps the simplest
model of DM that one can construct, LEP and DD
experiments strongly constrain it (as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:results_ZHSearches} and
in Reference~\citen{Escudero:2016gzx}). {Higgs portal}
models~\cite{Patt:2006fw,Djouadi:2011aa} are more promising, as
only the recent generations of collider and DD
experiments have reached the energies and luminosities necessary to
search for them. Direct collider searches for the
invisibly decaying Higgs bosons are augmented by measurements of
other Higgs properties, which can be very sensitive to couplings
to new particles.

The \textit{Z} and Higgs portal models have relatively simple
phenomenology. The mediator (the \textit{Z} or Higgs boson) is light in
comparison to the LHC energy and can be produced on-shell. Even if
the {\IP}s are much heavier and invisible decays of the mediator
are absent, collider searches may still study the \textit{Z} and Higgs bosons and
constrain these models through their fully visible decays.

\subsection{Effective Field Theories and Simplified Models of Beyond-the-Standard-Model Mediators}\label{sec:BSMMediatorModels}

More complex than the \textit{Z} and Higgs portal
models are models in which the mediator is also a new particle, such
as a heavier version of the $Z$ boson (a $Z^\prime$) or an
additional scalar.

\label{fig:feynman_0}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Effective field theories}\label{sub:EFT}

In some situations, such as when a BSM mediator is heavy compared
with the collision energy, the DM--SM matter interaction appears to be a
contact interaction, with all observables completely determined by
one rate parameter, the contact interacion scale, that controls
the production rate, and a Lorentz structure choice, which has a
modest effect on the \hl{transverse momentum}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: OK\ to introduce ``$p_{\mathrm {T}}$ here?**]}} distributions of the
{\IP}s. In this case, effective field theories
(EFTs)~\cite{Goodman:2010ku,Bai:2010hh,Fox:2011pm} describe the production of {\IP}s. Figure~\ref{fig:feynman_0}\textit{a} depicts an EFT
process. One may
hope that such a description is sufficient for the LHC; the
unknown high-energy details of a complicated interaction are
conveniently integrated out. Moreover, since EFTs do not fix a
mediation mechanism, they provide a framework to systematically
explore a wide range of possible physics.

If, instead, the interaction physics is kinematically accessible
(e.g., the mediator mass is within reach of the typical momentum
transfer in the collision), one should replace the EFT description
with a model specifying further details of the DM--SM matter
interactions~\cite{Shoemaker:2011vi}. Without those details,
however, one can still use the EFT language to obtain results for
later reinterpretation once \hl{a completion is
known}~\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: What/which ``completion''?**]}}\cite{Racco:2015dxa,Busoni:2013lha}.

\subsubsection{Simplified models}\label{sub:simplifiedModels}

When the collision energy is near or higher than the mediator
mass, complementary avenues to study the mediating interaction
develop, analogous to the transition from the Fermi model of weak
interactions at low energies to the SM at higher
energies. For example, at the LHC, a heavy neutral \Zprime
mediator would often decay into the partons that produced it, and
fully reconstructing these visible decays can provide more
information about the interaction than the invisible decays alone.

Under the reductionist assumption that only a few new particles
will be important in the early phase of a discovery, simplified
models can be developed for tree-level pair production of {\IP}s
(e.g.,~\citen{Alwall:2008ag, Alves:2011wf}). The set of such models
currently employed for ATLAS and CMS searches is described in
Reference~\citen{Abercrombie:2015wmb}, which builds upon much research from
the wider DM community
(e.g.,~\citen{Fox:2011pm,Abdallah:2015ter}). Although these simplified
models must be embedded in a larger theory to satisfy theory
constraints~\cite{Kahlhoefer:2015bea}, in many cases they are sufficient to
describe the leading-order collider phenomenology.

\begin{marginnote}[]
\entry{The ATLAS/CMS Dark Matter Forum}{provided the reference
implementations of the models in Reference~\citen{Abercrombie:2015wmb}
(see \url{https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhc-dmwg-material/model-repository}})
and implemented in models for various event generators [e.g.,
DMSimp~\cite{Backovic:2015soa}]
\end{marginnote}

The standard models include models with neutral mediator particles
singly produced at the LHC and decaying both to pairs of {\IP}s and to
pairs of SM particles (Figure~\ref{fig:monoX}{\em b},{\em
c}). Two-body mediator decays \hl{offer} simple, attractive benchmarks.\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Changed from ``are'' since decays are not benchmarks**]}}
Colored mediators allow vertices involving only one DM particle
and phenomenology akin to that of SUSY models with a squark
mediator~\cite{Papucci:2014iwa,An:2013xka,Bell:2012rg}.

Models of BSM mediation can be classified according to the spin of
the mediator: spin-1 vector or axial vector mediators (\Zprime),
scalar mediators (referred to as $\phi$ below) and spin-2
mediators. Spin-2 mediator benchmarks have not yet been adopted by
LHC searches; they produce diboson signatures not present in other
models~\cite{Han:2015cty}.
For additional decay signatures, for so-called dark sectors of many
additional particles, and for LHC data sets far larger than at
present, many more simplified models become interesting.

{Massive color-neutral spin-1 bosons with vector or
axial--vector couplings} are nearly ubiquitous in BSM theories, so
\Zprime bosons as the mediators connect with a wide class of
models~\cite{Shoemaker:2011vi}. Since the \Zprime coupling to
quarks must be nonzero for its production at the LHC, both
invisible and dijet signatures are discovery channels. This
coupling (or loop-level coupling) to SM partons is also required
for nuclear recoils in underground DM searches.

The models in use at ATLAS and CMS contain vector,
axial--vector, or mixed couplings to quarks and a single species of
{\IP}. The couplings of the \Zprime boson (\gq to all quarks, \gl to
leptons, and \gDM to {\IP}s), the mass of the invisible particle \mdm, and the
\Zprime mass \mmed are free parameters. Lepton decays, if not
included explicitly at tree level, arise through the quark
coupling at loop level (see Reference~\citen{Albert:2017onk} and
references therein). Decays of the spin-1 mediator into neutrinos
are also required by gauge invariance, and add an invisible decay
channel that can enhance signatures of missing transverse
momentum, depending on the size of the
couplings~\cite{Albert:2017onk}. The spin structure of the \Zprime
couplings does not significantly change the LHC phenomenology, but it
has a much greater effect in signals in noncollider searches.
An example process for this model is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:feynman_0}~\textit{(b,d)} in
the case of invisible and visible decays respectively.

\Zprime-mediated models can include additional couplings of the
\Zprime boson to acquire mass through a new baryonic Higgs boson,
$h_B$~\cite{Berlin:2014cfa}, through a coupling \ghZprimeZprime. 
This model collapses to the simpler vector model
above in the limit of very heavy \Zprime boson mass. 
An example Feynman diagram for this model is shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:feynman_1} \textit{(c)}. 
They can also be
embedded in a type II two-Higgs doublet model
(2HDM)~\cite{Berlin:2014cfa}, as in the diagram in Fig.~\ref{fig:feynman_1} \textit{(d)}.

With certain values of the model parameters, especially low
\Zprime mass, the model can satisfy the relic density
constraints~\cite{Chala:2015ama}. However, if taken in isolation,
the model is nonrenormalizable, and the axial--vector model
violates perturbative unitarity in certain regions of the
off-shell parameter
space~\cite{Chala:2015ama,Kahlhoefer:2015bea,Boveia:2016mrp}.

\label{fig:feynman_1}
\end{figure}

{Color-neutral scalar and pseudoscalar bosons} are a BSM
analog of the Higgs portal model. In comparison to the \Zprime
models, a BSM (pseudo-)scalar mediator
model~\cite{Buckley:2014fba} has some additional peculiarities.
Under MFV, the couplings of the (pseudo-)scalar bosons to fermions
are mass dependent. As with the Higgs boson, there are three
familiar consequences: (\textit{a})\ mediator production through loop-induced
couplings to gluons~\cite{Haisch:2015ioa} and associated with
heavy-flavor quarks~\cite{Buckley:2014fba}, (\textit{b})\ production
cross sections that are smaller than those for vector mediators, and (\textit{c})\ visible
decays of the mediator that are dominantly to third-generation quarks.
Despite lower production cross sections, the more specific
experimental signatures enable these models to be tested during
LHC Run 2.

The (pseudo-)scalar models used by ATLAS and CMS are fully
specified by the masses of the \IP\  and the mediator, the
$\phi$--\IP\  coupling (\gdm), and the $\phi$--fermion (\gq) coupling.
According to the convention used in~Reference \citen{Abercrombie:2015wmb}, \gq is a
prefactor to the Yukawa couplings to fermions and is set equal for
all quarks. For the same model parameters, the scalar and
pseudoscalar models predict similar kinematic distributions.

When introducing an additional scalar, one must consider how this new
scalar relates to the Higgs boson. Large mixing with the Higgs can
lead to strong constraints from Higgs measurements, for example,
when the scalar couples to DM through a Higgs
portal~\cite{Berlin:2014cfa}. If the mediators are pure SM
singlets, then the model is not invariant under
$SU(2)_L$~\cite{Bell:2016ekl}. Mixing
with the Higgs sector is crucial to restore gauge invariance. Couplings to the electroweak
gauge bosons can also be added as a consequence of electroweak
symmetry breaking~\cite{Bauer:2016gys,Englert:2016joy}. The
tree-level signatures in this case include Higgs or vector bosons
plus missing transverse momentum and, if the {\IP}s are
sufficiently light, invisible decays of the Higgs boson.

{Colored scalar and pseudoscalar bosons} allow direct
coupling between SM particles carrying color and {\IP}s carrying $Z_2$
charge~\cite{Bai:2013iqa, Papucci:2014iwa, An:2013xka,
Bell:2012rg}. Colored mediators can have a broader set of
multijet signatures and kinematic features than the neutral
mediator models, including the radiation of vector bosons by the
mediator~\cite{Bell:2012rg}.

In colored (pseudo-)scalar models, the mediator must be heavier
than the \IP\ so as  to ensure invisible-particle stability. For the current LHC results,
the coupling between {\IP}s and quarks (\gdmq), the invisible-particle  mass, and
the mediator mass are free parameters.

The exchange of a scalar colored under \textit{SU}(3) is analogous to
squarks in the minimal supersymmetric SM\ (MSSM), in which only squarks and neutralinos are light.
In the MSSM, the coupling between DM and the squark is constrained
to be small \cite{Abercrombie:2015wmb}. Without the requirements
of a SUSY framework, this coupling need not be small. For example,
if DM is a standard thermal relic, the couplings required to
obtain the correct DM density are generally higher than
what used by SUSY models. Models with three generations of
mediators can satisfy flavor constraints and the SM gauge
symmetry~\cite{Ko:2016zxg}.

\subsubsection{Less-simplified models}\label{sec:LessSimplifiedModels}

Simplified models can guide the design of generic searches but do
not cover the full complexity of possible collider signatures that
arise in more complete models. By contrast, relying too
heavily on a small sample of complete models risks focusing
searches too narrowly on an unrepresentative set of signatures.

There are a large number of ``less-simplified'' models that
attempt to find a middle ground between models that are too
simplistic and those that are unnecessarily complex. Because the
set of such models grows quickly with the number of components,
and because there is no broad consensus on which models should be a
priority, very few of them have been explicitly considered by LHC
searches. Here, we highlight a few such models with signatures different from those of
 the simplified models described above.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/feynman_2}

\label{fig:feynman_2}
\end{figure}

{Coannihilation} models add two \hl{specifies of dark sector
particle},\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Presumably a typo?\ If you mean ``species'', pls also change ``one similar in mass to the other'' to ``with similar masses''**]}} one similar in mass to the other (see References \citen{Buschmann:2016hkc} and \citen{Khoze:2017ixx} for examples). The interaction
between these two states drives the cosmological
history~\cite{Ellis:1999mm}, as processes involving both types of
particles can efficiently annihilate into SM particles. The LHC
signatures include \hl{missing transverse energy}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Please use ``missing transverse momentum,'' which is more in line with recent notation, and is also what is used in the first sidebar. Also, consider using a different symbol (slash${p_T}$ instead of \MET**]}} and multiple hadronic
jets accompanied by multiple \hl{resonant or nonresonant hadronic
jets}.\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: these terms are not in common use (and I can guess what is meant---presumably whether they come from resonances or not); in any case, they should not be used---please rephrase**]}} The signatures can be very diverse, encompassing those typically
found in wildly different BSM models (e.g., searches for
leptoquarks). In some cases, these signatures have not received much attention from any
current LHC search~\cite{Buschmann:2016hkc}.

Most simplified models in use at the LHC assume MFV to ensure that
the models are compatible with a vast and unwieldy assortment of
experimental constraints on flavor-violating processes.
Nevertheless, viable non-MFV\ models can be constructed, but one must then understand the impact of the
many constraints\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Where are these constraints coming from?\ Perhaps end with ``...constraints from experimental measurements.''**]}} \cite{Blanke:2017tnb}. Mediators that couple to
DM and a top quark appear in one category of flavor-violating
model that remains least constrained by low-energy
measurements~\cite{Boucheneb:2014wza}. These yield a distinct
``monotop'' LHC signature.

Other~{models with multiple mediators} with small couplings
to SM particles have been developed to escape existing LHC
constraints~\cite{Duerr:2016tmh}. The recent discovery of the
Higgs boson places the LHC at the forefront of the exploration of the
SM scalar sector. Ultimately, we do not yet know whether this scalar
sector is limited to the SM Higgs boson. A single scalar mediator
may not encode all of the important features of the complicated
phenomenology of more {complex scalar sectors}. Extended
scalar sector models often involve signatures with \MET accompanied by Higgs or other SM bosons. A step beyond the
simple scalar mediator model, dictated by gauge invariance, is to take mixing between this
mediator and the SM Higgs boson
into account~\cite{Bauer:2016gys,Berlin:2014cfa}. A much larger
step beyond that is to consider an extended Higgs sector such as a
2HDM, in which one or more of the scalars
acts as the mediator~between DM\ and SM\ matter \cite{Bauer:2017ota,Goncalves:2016iyg,Bell:2016ekl}. In
such models, the new mediator mixes with the Higgs partners
rather than with the SM Higgs, so the model remains
compatible with Higgs measurements. 

Some models developed for LHC
searches focus on one \hl{Yukawa structure (type II)}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Too technical, as it appears quite suddenly. Please define or add a reference**]}}. The particle
content includes two \textit{CP}-even bosons (of which one is the SM Higgs
boson), two \textit{CP}-odd bosons (of which one is the pseudoscalar DM
mediator), two charged Higgs bosons, and the \IP. Masses and
couplings of these models are chosen to respect vacuum
stability~\cite{Goncalves:2016iyg} as well as electroweak and flavor
constraints, and to reproduce the observed DM abundance.

\subsection{Supersymmetric Models and Other Complete Theories}\label{sec:SUSYModels}

So far, we have considered rather general simplified models
inspired by interactions found in the SM. Obviously, there are many more possibilities. Additional sources of inspiration for
searches are the large number of BSM theories that have been
developed to solve theoretical problems of the SM as well as the
mechanisms through which these provide {\IP}s.

SUSY is one such class of theories, postulating
partner particles to all SM degrees of freedom to stabilize the
mass of a light Higgs boson. Reviews of supersymmetric DM models
can be found elsewhere \cite{Feng:2010gw}. Here, we broadly
sketch models relevant to recent experimental progress and emphasize areas
where we expect future developments.

Supersymmetric relic DM, the archetype for the concept of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs),
has a long history \cite{1984NuPhB.238..453E}. The most
viable and well-studied \hl{type of supersymmetric relic DM}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Addition correct?**]}} has been neutralino DM. The
neutralino, a spin-1/2 partner particle to the SM gauge bosons, is
often assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP).
\textit{R} parity conservation makes the LSP stable~\cite{Farrar:1978xj}
and prevents proton decay.

In the MSSM, there are four neutralinos, each of which is a mixture of SM boson
superpartners: a wino, a bino, and two higgsino fermion states.
The lightest neutralino may be called bino-like, wino-like, or
higgsino-like in regions of MSSM parameter space where one of
these components dominates the mixture. The phenomenology of the neutralinos is different from that of most of the simplified models described in the previous
section, and it depends on the mixture and on the particle spectrum.
The LHC signatures feature missing transverse momentum from the
neutralino and a high multiplicity of other objects (leptons,
jets) produced in cascade decays of heavier superpartners.

The MSSM is a complete theory with more than 100 independent
parameters, but \hl{realistic SUSY models} \textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: given our complete lack of hints for SUSY, better not classify models as realistic (or not).  Perhaps use ``practical"?  Or, ``For practical reasons, simpler SUSY models with fewer parameters are used for designing SUSY searches and interpreting the results."?**]}}might be far simpler. Such
models are used as predictive benchmarks for DM searches. One such model is the phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM), which assumes no
sources of \textit{CP} violation beyond the SM and no flavor-changing neutral
currents, and retains universal couplings and masses for first- and
second-generation superpartners, reducing the number of MSSM
parameters to 19.

Another DM candidate in gauge- or gravity-mediated supersymmetric
models is the gravitino, a spin-3/2 particle superpartner of the
graviton. Gravitino interactions are suppressed by the Planck
scale (10$^{18}$ GeV) before SUSY breaking. This has consequences
both for their viability as a thermal relic and for their
phenomenology. In gauge-mediated SUSY, the gravitino can be a DM
candidate for a nonstandard cosmological
history~\cite{Dimopoulos:1996vz}. Similar to the neutralino case,
the identity and masses of heavier states decaying to the
gravitino LSP determine the gravitino's phenomenology. However, the gravitino
interactions are very weak, posing problems for both DD and
ID searches.

Because of the wide variety of potential experimental signatures,
SUSY searches often adopt a simplified model approach,
decoupling the particles that determine the lowest-energy collider
phenomenology [generally the LSP and the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP)] from the rest of a heavier
particle spectrum~\cite{Alves:2011wf}. As in the general
simplified models described above, extending the MSSM quickly
generates a plethora of nonminimal possibilities.

\subsection{Long-Lived Particle Models}\label{sec:LLPModels}

Another class of models found within and beyond SUSY feature suppressed cascade decays of a heavier particle (the NLSP
in SUSY) to a lighter particle (the DM LSP in SUSY). The
suppression can be so large that the particle travels a
macroscopic length within the detector before it decays. Within
SUSY, one way to achieve this suppression is for the NLSP to decay
through a heavy intermediary. Split SUSY models are a
subset of SUSY models in which the gluino must decay through a heavy,
off-shell squark~\cite{Masiero:2004ft}. The heavier the mass of
the squark is, the longer lived the gluino will be. Alternatively, the NLSP
decay can be heavily suppressed by some power of the mass
difference with the LSP. This mass difference also affects DM
coannihilation rates and therefore the DM
abundance~\cite{Ellis:1999mm}. Finally, another way to achieve
long-lived decays is with parametrically small couplings, as in
the case of gauge-mediated SUSY models wherein the
long-lived NLSP decays to its SM partner plus the
gravitino~\cite{Dimopoulos:1996vz}, in a SUSY analog of Cabibbo-suppressed \textit{B} meson decays in the SM. Because of the prevalence of
these mechanisms, it is important to look for long-lived cascade
decays.

In addition to SUSY, one can find long-lived signatures within the
generic simplified models described in Section \ref{sub:simplifiedModels}
for sufficiently small couplings. If one assumes thermal freeze-out, then the
coupling of the mediator to DM pairs is bounded from below to
obtain a sufficiently large annihilation cross section. However,
the early Universe mechanism that is
responsible for the observed DM density is not known. In alternate scenarios,
such as so-called dark freeze-out in which DM can annihilate directly to
BSM mediators but not vice versa, the mediator couplings to the SM
can be far smaller than allowed in standard thermal freeze-out~\cite{Pospelov:2007mp,Das:2010ts}. The freeze-in
scenario~\cite{Co:2015pka,Bernal:2017kxu} is another possibility
for very weak DM--SM matter interactions. Despite such small couplings, a
sufficiently light mediator can be produced at colliders with
an appreciable cross section. Many such models have been proposed. For example, DM can interact with the SM via a dark
vector boson of a \textit{U}(1)$^{\prime}$ dark symmetry, equivalent to the SM's \textit{U}(1)
but with much smaller couplings~\cite{Holdom:1985ag}, such as
those that originate from kinetic mixing. The mediator can also be a
dark scalar boson (a so-called dark Higgs) that couples only to the SM,
akin to a Higgs portal~\cite{Curtin:2014cca}. In both cases, the
dark boson mediator can be light and
long lived~\cite{Pospelov:2007mp}, and its visible decays into SM
particles or associated production with a SM boson provides the
main collider handle for observation~\cite{Curtin:2014cca}. These
scenarios can also be probed by complementary beam-dump and fixed-target experiments~\cite{Battaglieri:2017aum}. Simplified
coannihilation models with long-lived particles (LLPs) have also been
proposed~\cite{ElHedri:2017nny}.

\subsection{Dark Interactions}\label{sec:darkint}

In the above subsections, we have sketched some of the models and signatures
that are currently being sought at colliders. We now review
experimental searches for {\IP}s, in light of the models discussed
above\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: This sentence would be much more effective and would not break the flow if it would be moved to the end of the paragraph**]}}. However, we have left many models uncovered. From one
point of view, any model containing stable particles interacting
feebly with the SM is a theory of DM. Drawing the connections
between these models and astrophysical DM is challenging, but this
is the key difference between models of DM and other models of BSM
physics.

The dark sector can be arbitrarily complex, as long as the
particles and interactions it contains satisfy cosmological
observations~\cite{Strassler:2006im, Evans:2017kti}. The models
listed above are simple examples of such dark sectors, where the
mediator particles (e.g., dark bosons) provide the connection with
the SM. Many other models are worthy of mention here, including
asymmetric DM models, in which dark sector particles and
antiparticles are not produced in equal amounts, in the same
fashion as matter and antimatter for SM
baryons~\cite{Zurek:2013wia}, and models of neutral
naturalness that realize a mirror copy of the SM without any
low-mass equivalent of the SUSY colored
partners~\cite{Craig:2014aea}.\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: I suggest adding to this section perturbative limits on $g_q, g_x$, etc., typical values used (and why---for weak coupling, etc.), as this ``pedagogical'' material would make it easier for less expert readers to follow the discussion. It would also motivate the onslaught of $g_q, g_x$ values presented below. Also, Feynman diagrams would be very helpful, especially to graduate students using this review as an introduction to the topic**]}}

\section{EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS}\label{sec:03_ExperimentalResults}

The interactions described in the previous section have many
consequences for astrophysics (where they could modify the DM
density) and for collider and noncollider particle physics
experiments.
Collisions of known particles at high energy, observed with
well-understood detectors, have been a very successful tool,
leading to the discovery of many of the fundamental components of
known matter in the SM. While collider experiments alone cannot
discover DM, they can discover {the existence of \IP}s, and this could open up
direct study of DM--SM matter mediators in other channels and of
additional particles in a dark sector. DM--SM matter interactions may be
feeble because they are mediated by a heavy mediator or by a
mediator with small couplings to SM. Many high-energy collisions are needed to extensively search for these interactions, and the
LHC, which presently collides protons at a center-of-mass energy
of 13~TeV, will deliver both in the coming years.

Below, we discuss experimental searches for {\IP}s from three
LHC~\cite{LHC2008} experiments, ATLAS, CMS, and
LHCb~\cite{ATLAS2008,CMS2008,LHCb2008}, and briefly touch on some
results from previous colliders. The LHC results include up to
36~\ifb of proton--proton collision data taken through 2017 during Run 2,
more than three times what was used for the Higgs discovery but only
1\% of the data expected during the full High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC)
run.

Regarding signatures, we outline how the relevant searches are done, some
of the challenges, and the information they provide about the properties
of hypothetical particles (couplings, mediator mass, other
parameters of the Lagrangian in a particular model). \hl{In a later
chapter}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Which section(s) specifically?**]}}, we describe how collider information can be related to
noncollider DM searches and to the present DM abundance, such as
how conclusions drawn from relativistic collisions can be
extrapolated to the nonrelativistic collisions of DM+nucleons\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: the second clause seems to be dangling[?].  Perhaps ``The process allows the results drawn from relativistic collisions to be extrapolated to the nonrelativistic collisions of DM+nucleons."

\subsection{Searches for Invisible-Particle Production Mediated by Standard Model Bosons}\label{sec:results_ZHSearches}

Colliders have already provided spectacular evidence for copious production of low-mass invisible particles: the huge rate of neutrino production
mediated by the \textit{W} and \textit{Z} bosons. As a result, neutrino production via the \textit{Z}
boson is often the largest background to searches for new {\IP}s
and is important to understand well. The rate of \textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Text missing here?**]}}would differ from
the SM prediction if the \textit{Z} boson is coupled to additional {\IP}s
lighter than approximately half its mass. The most precise measurement of
the invisible \textit{Z} boson's width, 499.1 $\pm$ 1.5 MeV, has been inferred from
the total  \textit{Z}
width at LEP~\cite{ALEPH:2005ab}. This value can be used to
constrain the parameters of models such as \textit{Z}
portals~\cite{Carena:2003aj,Escudero:2016gzx}. The coupling
between the \textit{Z} boson and an invisible Dirac fermion is constrained to be
\hl{smaller than 2--3\%} \textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Please rephrase...  [Perhaps you mean of the corresponding SM values?]**]}}for {\IP}s that are significantly lighter than
half the \textit{Z} mass. A less precise direct measurement of the \textit{Z} boson's
invisible width, also by LEP, uses invisible decays with a photon
emitted as initial-state radiation (ISR), selecting events with a
single photon, the total invisible transverse momentum inferred
from momentum balance with the visible particles (\MET), and
little other event activity.  ISR+\MET has become a key
signature for invisible-particle searches at colliders. At the
LHC, precision measurements continue to test the production and
decay of \textit{Z} bosons for the effects of {\IP}s. For example, ATLAS
has measured the ratio of cross sections for jet and \MET
production, dominated by invisibly decaying \textit{Z} bosons, to
the production of \textit{Z} bosons decaying to dilepton pairs, a ratio that
is sensitive to the production of additional
{\IP}s~\cite{Aaboud:2017buf}.

The \textit{Z} boson is also key to invisible decays of the
newly discovered Higgs boson. In the SM, decays of the Higgs boson to neutrinos proceed through a pair of \textit{Z} bosons that decay invisibly and contribute less than 0.1\% of the total width of the Higgs boson. With
present data, this rate could become observable if the Higgs is
coupled to additional
{\IP}s~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau,Aad:2015pla}. To constrain the
invisible width of the Higgs, ATLAS and CMS cannot directly
measure its total width in a model-independent
fashion~\cite{Dobrescu:2012td}; instead, searches attempt to
directly observe these decays via their recoil against visible
particles (resulting in substantial \MET) or through a comparison of measurements of the
Higgs parameters under additional assumptions about the BSM
physics. Direct Higgs-to-invisible searches have used Run 1 and
Run 2 data, combining several strong and electroweak production
channels. A combination of direct and indirect searches yields the most
stringent upper bound on the fraction of invisible decays of the Higgs
boson: 23\%~\cite{Khachatryan:2016whc,Aad:2015pla}. This places
constraints on Higgs portal couplings of 1--2\% for Dirac {\IP}s
much lighter than half the Higgs mass.

\subsection{Generic Searches for Invisible Particles from Beyond-the-Standard-Model Mediation}\label{sec:results_monoXSearches}

Searches for invisible decays via an SM mediator (the \textit{Z} or Higgs boson)
can be viewed as special cases of searches for more general BSM
mediation of {\IP}s. Since mediator decays to {\IP}s are
suppressed if the invisible-particle  mass is heavier than half the mediator mass,
the fixed masses of SM mediators place an upper bound of $\sim$45--65 GeV on the invisible-particle mass that can be observed. Moreover, the
distribution of \MET in such events has a similar shape to that of
the \textit{Z} boson--mediated neutrino background.

\begin{textbox}
\section{MEASURING INVISIBLE PARTICLES: \MET RECONSTRUCTION}

\noindent Precise measurements in all detector systems are crucial
for measurements of \MET in experiments at hadron colliders, as the
calculation should include all particles in the event.
Contributions that are not attributed to physics objects form the
soft component of the \MET~\cite{Aad:2016nrq,CMS-PAS-JME-16-004}.
One of the main challenges for \MET measurements is excluding
contributions from additional proton--proton interactions whose
debris are detected at nearly the same time as the hard scatter
(pileup). Searches for invisible particles also need to reject
events with high \MET if the visible energy is due to
noncollision backgrounds.

{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: the three paragraphs are disconnected.  It would be better to form full sentences rather than start the second and third paragraphs with ``Challenge:''**]}}Challenge: pileup in \MET reconstruction.} In addition to
suppressing pileup suppression within the calorimeters, tracking
information can be used to determine whether energy deposits
originate from the primary collision vertex. The combination of
this information is used to remove pileup both in the physics
objects used for \MET calculation and in the overall event energy
balance~\cite{CMS-PAS-JME-16-004,ATLAS-CONF-2014-019}.

{Challenge: fake \MET rejection.} Noncollision
backgrounds, such as cosmic rays, beam background, and detector
noise have a significant contribution to the tails of the \MET
spectrum (Figure~\ref{fig:fakeMET}). Specific quality
cuts, based on the presence of tracks associated with the deposited
energy and on the energy deposited in the various calorimeter layers,
are applied to reject these events~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-029}. The
number of events passing the jet+\MET analysis selection before
these quality cuts is approximately 10 times larger than the SM
contribution~\cite{Aaboud:2016tnv}.\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Please insert a callout to this sidebar in the main text**]}}
\end{textbox}

For heavier BSM mediators, this is not necessarily the case. Their
decay to {\IP}s can produce \MET distributions substantially
different from the SM background. The complexity of the processes
mediating invisible-particle production determines the composition
of the visible recoil, so searches are employed across many
different visible-particle signatures. Nevertheless, many collider
searches, from LEP to the Tevatron to the most recent LHC searches
(e.g.,~\citen{Fox:2011fx,Bai:2010hh}), aim to be model agnostic,
designed to detect an excess of \MET over the SM background with
minimal assumptions about the visible objects in the recoil.
Selecting events (triggering) in a model-agnostic way\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: need to specify that this is an online or real-time selection**]}} can often be
done by looking for substantial \MET, but for models that do not
produce large \MET, one is forced to assume more about the visible
recoil. We begin with the jet+\MET search, which illustrates
techniques used in other general invisible-particle searches and
shares with them many of the same challenges. Traditionally, these
have been called mono-\textit{X} searches, but the radiation of a single
object is only the leading process in the simplest
reactions~\cite{Haisch:2013ata}.

\begin{marginnote}[]
\entry{Trigger}{selects which LHC collisions are recorded
for analysis (for descriptions of the ATLAS and CMS triggers, see
Reference \citen{Smith:2016vcs})\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: This definition is unnecessary, given the sidebar on challenges in triggering**]}}}
\end{marginnote}

\subsubsection{Searches with jets}

One way to reduce the model dependence of the searches is to
require that the recoiling visible particles be produced by SM
processes, not in the dark interaction. ISR meets this criteria.
SM bosons are likely to be present in any BSM process, radiated
from initial-state partons at rates fixed by the SM. Because gluon
ISR is far more prevalent than the other forms, the jet+\MET
search is key in this approach.

A LHC jet+\MET search~\cite{Aaboud:2017phn,Sirunyan:2017jix}
typically selects collision events with a moderate amount of \MET
(in the 13-TeV analyses, typically above 200 GeV, sufficient to
record such events at a manageable rate) and at least one jet with
transverse momentum (\pt) higher than 100--200 GeV in the central
region of the detector ($|\eta|<2.4$).\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Please define $\eta$ here**]}} From this sample, further
restrictions on additional hadronic jets and other visible
particles are used to suppress contributions from SM processes and
from instrumental backgrounds causing spurious \MET. These
requirements reduce the generality of the analysis but also better
isolate signal-like events. For example, contributions from \textit{W}
bosons decaying to leptons are reduced by vetoing events with
leptons, and top quark pair production is reduced by limiting the number
of jets present. The remaining SM multijet processes can exhibit
high \MET when one or more jets are mismeasured. Such
mismeasurements often result in \MET along the axis of a jet, and
this feature is used to reduce the background to approximately 1\% of the
total. Noncollision events (e.g., intersecting cosmic rays,
beam--gas interactions, and calorimeter problems) can also produce
spurious \MET events. Figure~\ref{fig:fakeMET} shows that such
events dominate a high-\MET data sample unless they are rejected with
criteria tailored to the expected collision time and detector
hardware.

After the above criteria \hl{are satisfied}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Addition correct?**]}}, one arrives at a sample composed mainly
of invisible decays of the \textit{Z} boson (approximately 55--70\% of the
total background). A substantial rate of semileptonic decays of
the \textit{W} boson also survives the lepton veto when the lepton is not
reconstructed (approximately 20--35\% of the total background.
The main observable is typically the number of events in one or
more \MET signal regions, either exclusive (in bins of
\MET) or inclusive (considering all events above a given \MET
threshold).

\begin{marginnote}[]
\entry{Signal region}{a population of events enriched in
contributions from signal processes; data in this region are

contributions but with other characteristics close to the signal
region; control data are used to model or validate SM
predictions}
\end{marginnote}

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/FakeMET}
\caption{The \MET distribution of events, selected for high total

predictions of Monte Carlo  simulations (\textit{shaded areas}) are also shown. Strong
noncollision background suppression is vital to \textit{X}+\MET analyses.}
\label{fig:fakeMET}
\end{figure}

Because {\IP}s have feeble interactions with the colliding
partons, and thus low production cross sections, these searches
need \hl{very precise} \textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: isn't ``very precise" an exaggeration here?  [Even ``precise" is -- in some cases".]  Suggest dropping ``very" (at a minimum...) **]}}estimates of the shapes of the backgrounds. A
background estimate solely from Monte Carlo simulation is subject to
uncertainties in both theory and detector simulation affecting the
total cross sections, and therefore is not precise enough. To
estimate the \textit{Z}- and \textit{W}-mediated neutrino backgrounds, recent ATLAS
and CMS searches combine the information from data, in signal-free
{control regions} selecting visible boson (\textit{W},
\textit{Z}, $\gamma$)+jet processes, with the most recent perturbative
calculations~\cite{Lindert:2017olm}, yielding much more precise estimates.
ATLAS\ estimates backgrounds from top processes using a
control region with $b$ jets, while CMS takes this background from
simulation. Estimates of smaller backgrounds rely more heavily on
simulation.

Currently, the precision achieved for the background estimate is 2--7\%
(CMS) and 2--10\% (ATLAS), depending on the \MET range. The
remaining uncertainties arise mainly from the identification of
leptons (CMS) and the understanding of jet and \MET
calibration (ATLAS).

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: This paragraph is a good example of where the reader is mystified as to why the specific values of $g_q, g_x$ are used.  Some more motivation would be quite helpful to the reader**]}}With no excesses observed, these searches set 95\%-CL limits
on the production cross section of {\IP}s, typically ranging from
0.5 \pb to 2 \fb, depending on the \MET
threshold~\cite{Aaboud:2017phn}. ATLAS and CMS also report
constraints for a selection of mediator models. These constraints
can be interpreted as limits on the interactions between the
mediator and the SM (e.g., \gq) under specific sets of model
assumptions, not on the mass and other properties of the {\IP}s
per se. As an example, for the simplified model with
(axial--)vector mediators, mediator masses of up to
1.5--1.9~TeV~\cite{Aaboud:2017phn,Sirunyan:2017jix} are ruled out
for an invisible coupling of \gdm=1. For mediators lighter than
this bound, the search can exclude SM couplings of order 0.1 or,
alternatively, lower \gdm values than unity. With this amount of
data, the searches are also becoming sensitive to lower-rate
interactions mediated by (pseudo-)scalar mediators, and a recent
ATLAS search~\cite{Aaboud:2017phn} sets explicit constraints on
colored scalar mediators, where, for unit couplings and invisible
particle masses of up to 100 GeV, the mass of the mediator is
constrained to be above 1.7 TeV. Jet+\MET results from LHC Run 1
and the Tevatron have also reported constraints on EFT models.

Since this type of search can constrain a wider variety of
interactions than explicitly considered, steps have been taken to
allow easy reinterpretation of the results. ATLAS and CMS provide
more detailed experimental results on the HEPData
platform~\cite{Maguire:2017ypu}. CMS also provides a simplified
likelihood function encapsulating the
result~\cite{Collaboration:2242860,Sirunyan:2017jix}.

\subsubsection{Searches with photons and vector bosons}\label{subsub:monoV}

Particles other than gluons can constitute visible-particle
recoil. In models where the recoil arises from ISR, the rates
for photon and electroweak boson radiation are much smaller than
for gluon radiation. Nevertheless, searches in photon+\MET and
\textit{Z}+\MET channels can play a complementary role alongside jet+\MET\ searches,
with a smaller and different mix of backgrounds and different
systematic uncertainties. Both ATLAS and CMS have performed
searches in each channel. With lower backgrounds, events can be
recorded with lower kinematic thresholds, resulting in lower \MET
and visible-\pt{} selections. For example, the lowest \MET value
probed by the \textit{Z}+\MET search, where the \textit{Z} decays into
leptons~\cite{Sirunyan:2017qfc,Aaboud:2017bja}, is around 100 GeV,
versus 200 GeV for the jet+\MET search~\cite{Sirunyan:2017jix}.

These searches can play a much more powerful role when the recoil
arises from the dark interaction itself rather than ISR. In these
cases, photon or vector boson recoil
(e.g.,~\citen{Birkedal:2004xn,Carpenter:2012rg}), rather than gluon
recoil, may be the dominant signature. In these searches, the
event selection and the background estimation strategies generally
mirror those of the jet+\MET search, but vary with the type of
recoil, taking advantage of the special features of the signal. In
photon+\MET searches~\cite{Aaboud:2017dor,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-014},
components of hadronic showers misidentified as isolated photons
are a sizable background to be rejected. The searches with
electroweak bosons decaying hadronically use jet substructure
techniques~\cite{Sirunyan:2017jix,Aaboud:2016qgg} to recover
information about boson mass and decay in events where the decay
products from the high-\pt{} boson are collimated. QCD jets do
not present any substructure~\cite{Larkoski:2017jix}, while the
decay products of vector bosons grouped into large-radius jets
have a typical two-prong pattern from the hadronization of the
quark--antiquark pair.\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: This paragraph, which has to explain substructure etc., is too brief given the topic.  Please expand it and use a more basic description/introduction to the topic**]}}

None of these searches have yet observed a signal. The searches are generally not
as sensitive as the jet+\MET search to models in which the
visible recoil arises from ISR, because of smaller signal
acceptance and a comparable signal-to-background ratio. Nevertheless, they can
be remarkably competitive:\ The
photon+\MET searches are the next-to-most-powerful probe after the jet+\MET searches. Moreover,
these searches provide the most stringent limits on some models
in which the boson in question is directly involved in the dark
interaction~\cite{Berlin:2014cfa}.

\subsubsection{Search signatures including the Higgs boson}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: This section would benefit from Feyman-like (simplified) diagrams**]}}One can also look for the newly discovered Higgs boson in the
recoil, but due to the heavy mass of the Higgs and the small
heavy-flavor content of the proton, the rate of Higgs ISR is
insignificant. Thus, searches for Higgs+\MET target dark
interactions in which the Higgs is a direct participant and,
therefore, the interaction is closely tied to the Higgs sector.
This is a feature of many models that extend the SM scalar sector.

Dedicated searches for Higgs+\MET  select Higgs events similar to
the inclusive Higgs measurements, then require substantial \MET to
reduce the backgrounds to the search. In the Run 2 data, searches
in the $H \rightarrow
\gamma\gamma$~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-054,Aaboud:2017uak} and $H
\rightarrow b\bar{b}$~\cite{Aaboud:2017yqz} channels have been
performed. Searches in the $ZZ,~WW$, and $\tau\tau$ channels are
expected to contribute as well, once substantially more data have been
collected.

The \MET+$H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$
searches~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-054,Aaboud:2017uak} benefit from
their ability to precisely constrain the diphoton pair to the
Higgs boson mass. They are still statistically- limited. The
relatively low backgrounds enable probing for anomalous \MET as low
as 50 GeV~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-054}. The diphoton-invariant mass
is fitted in different signal categories, each optimized for
different types of signal models. The search for a Higgs boson decaying to
two bottom quarks~\cite{Aaboud:2017yqz} requires \MET$>$150 GeV.
All backgrounds except for the QCD background are estimated using
Monte Ccarlo simulation and constrained in dedicated control regions. This search
also employs jet substructure techniques for \MET$>$500 GeV to
select boosted Higgs decays amid a background of QCD processes.
The main systematic uncertainty for the lower \MET signal region
is the modeling of the \textit{V}+jets background, while a higher-\MET
signal region is still statistically limited with the current
data set.

In the absence of a signal, limits are placed on the baryonic Higgs benchmark
model outlined in Section~\ref{sub:simplifiedModels} with \gq=1,
\gdm=1, \ghZprimeZprime/$m_{Z}$=1, and \sinthetab=0.3, and on a
\Zprime--2HDM.\footnote{In the case of the \Zprime--2HDM, CMS and ATLAS set different masses for the new Higgs
bosons, so the constraints are not yet directly comparable.} 
Higgs+\MET and \textit{Z}+\MET searches are also sensitive to extended
scalar sectors such as two Higgs doublets with a scalar or
pseudoscalar
mediator~\cite{Bauer:2017ota,Goncalves:2016iyg,Bell:2016ekl}.

\subsubsection{Searches with third-generation quarks}

In scalar- and pseudoscalar-mediated simplified models, one can
exploit the production mechanism in the design of the search. For
instance, the mediator can be produced along with two top or
bottom quarks, leading to a signature that includes \MET and multiple \textit{b} jets.

A recent ATLAS search in these channels~\cite{Aaboud:2017rzf} is
optimized for both recoil consisting of semileptonic and fully
hadronic top quark decays and recoil with one or two bottom
quarks. This signature is similar to that of third-generation
quark superpartners and can be part of dedicated SUSY searches or
used for reinterpretation~\cite{Aaboud:2017aeu,Sirunyan:2017leh}.
SUSY searches suppress most of the $t\bar{t}$ background, matching
specific models to specific, low-background signal regions.
Relative to these approaches, the search described in
Reference~\citen{Aaboud:2017rzf} is less narrowly targeted at specific
models, where control regions can be more reliably developed,
instead relying more heavily on simulation. The sensitivity of
searches of \MET associated with top quarks is comparable for the
two strategies.

No excess is observed in any of these searches. For invisible-particle masses of
1 GeV, color-neutral pseudoscalar mediators with masses in the range of 20--50
GeV~\cite{Aaboud:2017aeu} and scalar mediators with mass up to 100
GeV~\cite{Sirunyan:2017leh} are excluded. Signatures with
$b\bar{b}$ pairs are less sensitive to models that do not
explicitly privilege bottom quarks, but they can set much higher limits
on colored mediator masses in the case of preferential couplings to
bottom quarks~\cite{Agrawal:2014una}.

Other LHC searches in this category are those including only
one top or bottom quark (also called monotop or monobottom
searches)~\cite{Sirunyan:2018gka, Aad:2014wza}. They place
constraints on models that include singly produced {\IP}s through
flavor-changing neutral currents~\cite{Boucheneb:2014wza}.

\subsection{Searches for Supersymmetric Invisible Particles}\label{sec:results_SUSYSearches}

So far motivated by simple models, the \textit{X}+\MET experimental
searches discussed make few choices about the visible recoil
particles (i.e., the species of a single particle), yet they have
already led to a plethora of diverse signatures. Models with more degrees of freedom vastly expand the set of
signatures to be explored. SUSY adds, along with
{\IP}s, a full copy of the SM particle
spectrum. Each superpartner features particular decay chains that
can be targeted to a greater or lesser degree, privileging either
generality or maximal sensitivity. Compared with the generic
searches described above, SUSY searches generally opt for a more specific
decay topology and thus apply more stringent event selections
based on the expected kinematic features, often using
discriminating variables based on the combined mass of visible and
invisible particles (e.g.,~\citen{Lester:1999tx}) to recover
the ability to resolve various resonant decays.

SUSY has received much attention from ATLAS and CMS, and many
searches for its particles, such as for squarks and gluinos, have
a long history at earlier colliders as well. In this section, we
discuss experimental results of more recent interest.

So far, no SUSY search has produced a conclusive signal. However,
given its multifarious signatures, it is difficult to make general
statements about the current status, even for simplified models of
SUSY. Perhaps the best one can say is that searches for
strongly produced superpartners constrain them for masses
approaching \hl{a couple of TeV}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Too colloquial; replace with ``$\sim$2 TeV''**]}} (Figure~\ref{fig:SUSYSummary_ew})
(e.g.,~\citen{Aaboud:2017bac,Sirunyan:2017yse}), for neutralino
masses up to 1 TeV; by contrast, other processes are
less constrained. Direct production of weakly coupled
superpartners has a much smaller production rate; therefore, the
constraints on them are significantly weaker. Third-generation
squarks are generally only constrained to be at least several
hundred GeV for neutralinos of similar masses (e.g.,~\citen{Sirunyan:2017wif,Aaboud:2016wna}). But there are
numerous exceptions to these blanket statements, even before one
takes into account that the masses exclusions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SUSYSummary_ew} 
apply only to specific slices of a multidimensional model parameter
space.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/SUSY_electroweak.pdf}
\caption{Mass reach of (\textit{a})\ CMS and (\textit{b})\ ATLAS searches for a selection of
results targeting electroweak supersymmetry production, available as of
December 2017.

\end{figure}

Although LHC searches have so far probed mainly  SUSY channels that are strongly produced, searches for more rare processes are now entering their prime. With the data now collected, one can explore the
electroweakino parameter space (e.g.,~\citen{Sirunyan:2018ubx,ATLAS:2017uun}). Searches for gauge
boson superpartners (gauginos) can reach approximately 1 TeV if
the superpartners of SM leptons are light, and the search can
benefit from a high leptonic branching ratio, whereas their reach
is lower if their decays proceed through \textit{W} and \textit{Z} bosons. More
luminosity also provides access to new regions of parameter space
for specific signatures, such as so-called compressed regions where small
mass differences between superpartners cause the signals to lie
buried in large backgrounds at low
\MET~\cite{Aaboud:2017leg,Sirunyan:2017zss}. Small mass
differences can also suppress superpartner decays, resulting in
long lifetimes that can be exploited to study regions with a mass
difference as low as 0.2 GeV for Higgsino
\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Should ``Higgsino'' be lowercased here, as above?**]}}models~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-019}. Other mechanisms of decay
suppression can do this as well [e.g., split
SUSY~\cite{Sirunyan:2018vjp}].

Despite the unwieldy diversity SUSY signatures, a sufficiently
specific model can provide a concrete framework on which to build
an understanding of the combined effect of many experimental
constraints. The study reported in Reference \citen{Conley:2010du}, continued in LHC
experiments\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Continued WITHIN the experiments or FOR the experiments?\ By the same authors?**]}}~\cite{Aad:2015baa, Khachatryan:2016nvf}, uses the
pMSSM to define a finite (although large) parameter space for
which the wealth of experimental constraints can be systematically
evaluated. Although this approach is not exhaustive, it can identify
underexamined signatures for future emphasis\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: The nonexpert reader will be mystified by this statement**]}}. One may also identify the LSP with astrophysical DM
to focus more specifically on regions compatible with a given
cosmology~(e.g., \citen{Aaboud:2016wna}).

Collaborations such as GAMBIT~\cite{Athron:2017ard} and
Mastercode~\cite{Bagnaschi:2017tru} have combined a variety of
tools to aid in such efforts. These codes encapsulate search
results in statistical outputs that can be combined to construct
global constraints for the models of interest. For example, one
may compile the likelihood functions for the parameters of a SUSY
model given the results from collider, DD, and ID experiments.

\subsection{Searches in Association with Long-Lived Particles}\label{sec:results_LLPSearches}

Prompt decays produce a visible recoil that originates at the collision
point; thus, it can be reconstructed using the techniques for
which the experiments were designed. The long-lived mediators
described in Section~\ref{sec:LLPModels} present different
experimental challenges. For short lifetimes, LLPs can decay inside the tracking detectors, appearing as
displaced decay vertices. Some SUSY decay chains lead to
disappearing tracks, if the visible particles decay into the LSP
and soft particles (e.g.,~\citen{Aaboud:2017mpt, CMS:2014gxa}).
Even longer-lived particles can decay in the calorimeters or in
the muon spectrometers, or they may exit the detector cavern
completely before decaying. These complications add yet another
dimension of complexity to such searches, because observing the
events may require dedicated triggers, reconstruction algorithms,
and even detectors \cite{Ball:2016zrp,Chou:2016lxi}.

Searches at colliders use a variety of experimental signatures to
target different types of dark bosons, such as dark vector or
scalar bosons. An LHCb search for dimuon
resonances~\cite{Aaij:2017rft} is sensitive to visible decays of
vector mediators in the mass range between 10 and 70 GeV. This
search can use the entire sample of dimuon decays delivered to
LHCb, recorded at the full collision rate directly at the trigger
level~\cite{Aaij:2016rxn}. Below 10 GeV, experiments at
electron--positron colliders have searched for dilepton resonances
or missing mass produced in association with ISR photons (e.g.,~\citen{Lees:2014xha,Lees:2017lec}). LHCb also searches dimuon
events for scalar bosons with masses between 250 MeV and 4.7
GeV~\cite{Aaij:2016qsm}, for a range of lifetimes. Dark bosons can
also arise in Higgs decays via a hidden-sector mechanism. For
example, the searches described in References \citen{ATLAS:2016jza} and \citen{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-035}
look for exotic Higgs decays into collimated lepton-jets,
constraining the decay rate to be below 10\% for a range of dark
photon lifetimes. Reference~\citen{Curtin:2014cca} provides a review of
\hl{many possibilities}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Do you mean ``many other possibilities''?\ Otherwise it's unclear how this sentence fits with the previous one**]}}.

\subsection{Consequences of Neutral-Mediated Models: Visible Decays}\label{sec:MediatorSearches} \label{sub:twoBody}

Dark interactions might also be probed without actually producing
{\IP}s. For example, if the mediator particle can be produced via
interactions with quarks, it may also decay into quarks. In this
case, dijet and top--top resonance searches (e.g.,~\citen{Liew:2016oon,Chala:2015ama}) can constrain it.

Dijet resonance searches have been routinely used at hadron
colliders to probe for new particles at newly reached collision
energies. They exploit an expected absence of features in the
dijet-invariant mass distribution to estimate the search
background directly from a fit to the data, minimizing modeling
and theory uncertainties. This permits the observation of low-rate
localized excesses (width/mass of up to $\sim$15\%) from resonant
dijet production~\cite{Aaboud:2017yvp,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-056}. For
wider signals, searches exploiting the scattering angle of dijet
events can be used~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-046,Aaboud:2017yvp}.

\begin{textbox}
\section{CHALLENGES FOR TRIGGERING AT HADRON COLLIDERS}

\noindent The LHC collides protons every 25 $\mathrm{ns}$ in nominal
conditions. The decision to record collision events for further
analysis is made by the trigger
system~\cite{Smith:2016vcs,Aaboud:2016leb,Khachatryan:2016bia}.
Its first, hardware-based level uses partial detector information
for fast decisions. Its second, software-based level uses more
refined algorithms and has access to further detector information.

{Triggering on low-\pt objects}: The trigger system records
events above a certain threshold (e.g., leading-jet \pt or event
\MET), since energetic processes are likely to contain interesting
features. Only a small fraction of events below these thresholds
is recorded, penalizing signals with lower-energy signatures.
However, if only final-state objects reconstructed by the trigger
system are recorded, instead of full event information, the
storage limitations can be
overcome~\cite{Aaij:2016rxn,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-056,Aaboud:2016leb}.

{{Pileup} in trigger}: Pileup can add energy
uncorrelated to the hard process of interest, increasing the event
rate for a given trigger threshold; trigger \MET rates increase
exponentially with the number of additional interactions. For this
reason, increases in LHC instantaneous luminosity and data set size
come at the cost of increased thresholds. Dedicated pileup
suppression algorithms, including partial tracking information, are
used in trigger
reconstruction~\cite{CMS:2014ata,ATLAS-CONF-2014-019}. ATLAS and
CMS foresee dedicated hardware systems to obtain full tracking
information in future LHC
runs~\cite{Shochet:2013gaw,1748-0221-6-12-C12065}.
\end{textbox}

At the LHC, typical dijet searches lose sensitivity at masses
below approximately 1 TeV~\cite{An:2012ue,Dobrescu:2013coa}, where high
rates force the experiments to discard a large fraction of the
data at the level of the trigger (see the sidebar titled Challenges of Triggering at Hadron Colliders). One can reduce this threshold to 400
GeV~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-056,ATLAS:2016xiv} by recording much less
information for these low-mass
events~\cite{Aaij:2016rxn,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-056,Aaboud:2016leb}.
Alternatively, one can look at the subset of dijet events in which a
high-\pt{} ISR object happens to
trigger\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Some of this has already been mentioned, so please add something that acknowledges as much (e.g., ``as mentioned in Section...'').**]}}~\cite{ATLAS:2016bvn,Sirunyan:2017nvi}. Even lower mediator
masses can be reached\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Is a word missing here?**]}} exploiting substructure techniques when the
mediator decays are collimated into a single
jet~\cite{Sirunyan:2017nvi,Aaboud:2018zba}. Dedicated searches for
resonances of third-generation
quarks~\cite{lowMassDiB,CMS-PAS-HIG-16-025,Aaboud:2017hnm} are
also performed.

Dilepton resonance searches also constrain mediator couplings to
leptons~\cite{Aaboud:2017buh,Khachatryan:2016zqb}. For dielectron
and dimuon searches, the main backgrounds arise from Drell--Yan
processes, which are estimated with simulations corrected for next-to-next-to-leading-order
effects and normalized to the \textit{Z} boson yield in the data.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/CouplingMassPlot.pdf}
\caption{Summary of constraints from searches for light dijet
resonances from ATLAS and CMS, where discrete points are taken
from the coupling-mass limits on a simplified model mediated by an

searches mentioned in the text, and interpolated at the crossings.

values where larger couplings yield a resonance width larger than
15\% (roughly \gq $>$ 0.5). Abbreviation:\ DM, dark matter. Pre-LHC constraints are from Reference \citen{Dobrescu:2013coa}.}\label{fig:couplingmass}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:couplingmass} illustrates constraints from the
dijet resonance searches mentioned above, on the quark coupling of
the mediator in an axial--vector simplified model, as a function of
the mediator mass, for a model that assumes no tree-level
couplings to leptons and no possible decay to DM. Searches for
boosted mediator decays are sensitive to masses as low as 50 GeV
and quark couplings \gq as low as 0.06 at 60 GeV. Jets from the
mediator decay are spatially separated for mediator masses above
250--300 GeV, where the $\gamma$ and gluon ISR+dijet channel
constrains \gq to be greater than 0.15--0.2. Above 400 GeV, where searches with
jets at the trigger level become available, they are the most
sensitive, excluding \gq as low as 0.05. Above 1 TeV, standard
dijet resonance and angular searches constrain quark couplings
from 0.1 to unity, up to 5 TeV.

Mixing between this mediator and the \textit{Z} boson induces loop-level
couplings to leptons. ATLAS and CMS use several sets of coupling
benchmarks to illustrate how the experimental constraints depend
on these unknown values. For equal couplings of the mediator to
leptons and jets, dilepton searches at a given mediator mass are
far more sensitive than dijet searches. Other values are
discussed further in the next section.

\subsubsection{Comparison of the sensitivity of visible and invisible LHC searches}\label{sub:comparisonVisibleInvisible}

Fully visible signatures of a particular dark interaction can be
powerful probes of it and, in some cases (e.g., when the {\IP}s
are too heavy to be directly produced), are the only way to observe
dark interactions at a collider. By contrast, only \MET
searches can observe invisible-particle production directly.
Each type of search complements the others; nevertheless, piecing
together searches in different channels requires a model.
Understanding precisely how these searches fit together can be
challenging when the model is uncertain.

As an example, we again consider the case of vector or
axial--vector mediators, to which both jet+\MET and two-body
resonance searches are sensitive. Although these models are simple,
they involved four parameters: two couplings, the invisible-particle
mass, and the mediator mass. Recent ATLAS and CMS results depict
results in a two-dimensional plane of mediator mass and DM
mass, following the recommendations of the LHC Dark Matter Working
Group.\footnote{Akin to simplified models of SUSY, where the axes
are neutralino mass and superpartner particle mass.}
Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivityComparison} shows a sample of
recent ATLAS plots. The remaining coupling parameters are
fixed to one of several benchmark sets that are selected on the basis of the
sensitivity of early Run 2 searches, precision constraints, and
the complementarity of different types of searches. Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivityComparison} displays the
constraints from dijet, dilepton, and \textit{X}+\MET searches on the
interaction model as excluded regions of the model
parameter space.

Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivityComparison}\textit{a} shows the constraints for couplings
\gq=0.25, \gl=0, and \gdm=1. In this case, dijet searches exclude
mediators between approximately 200~GeV and 2.6~TeV, while \textit{X}+\MET searches
can constrain even lighter mediators. Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivityComparison}\textit{b} shows the
exclusions for smaller quark couplings, \gq = 0.1, and a nonzero
lepton coupling, \gl = 0.01, chosen as indicative of the possible
size of loop-induced lepton couplings. With lower quark couplings,
and thus lower dijet production and decay rates, the regions of
masses excluded by the several dijet searches shrink. For
mediators heavier than 150 GeV, the exclusions from the recent
dilepton search fare better but do not extend very far into the
(smaller) region excluded by the jet+\MET search, where mediator
decays to DM dominate.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/SummaryPlotsMassMass.pdf}
\caption{Regions in dark matter mass--\Zprime mediator mass
excluded at 95\% CL by a selection of ATLAS dark matter searches
for two coupling scenarios. Dashed curves labeled ``thermal
relic'' indicate combinations of dark matter and mediator mass
that are consistent with a dark matter density of $\omega_c = 0.12
h^2$ and a standard thermal history, as computed in MadDM for this
model~\cite{Backovic:2015cra}. The dotted curve indicates the
kinematic threshold where the mediator can decay on-shell into
dark matter. Abbreviations:\ DM, dark matter; ISR, initial-state radiation; TLA, \textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Please define this term here**]}}. Adapted from~Reference \citen{ATLASSummary}.}
\label{fig:sensitivityComparison}
\end{figure}

Thus, the relative sensitivity of visible and invisible searches
is both model and coupling dependent. One advantage of
searches for {\IP}s is their sensitivity to models
with very light mediators ($<$50 GeV) and light \mdm, since the
reach of dijet and dilepton searches to low-mass resonances is
still ultimately limited by data-taking constraints.

\section{EXTRAPOLATION OF COLLIDER RESULTS}\label{sec:04_Extrapolation}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: Please consider using an alternate section title that better reflects to the reader the content, e.g., ``Comparison of collider results with dedicated DM experiments"**]}}A wide variety of reactions may produce {\IP}s at colliders, and
if the mediators of the interaction are light enough to be
produced on-shell, collider experiments are particularly well suited to
discovering and characterizing the interactions responsible.
Meanwhile, connecting a collider experiment's discovery or
nondiscovery of {\IP}s to DM requires both DD and
ID experiments, wherein Galactic DM
collides with a terrestrial target or extragalactic DM
annihilates.

Making this connection requires that one assume a particle
physics model. Within a given model and under well-specified
assumptions, the information obtained in a collider experiment can
be related to the information obtained in direct, indirect, and
astrophysical probes, and vice versa. One can then compare and
contrast the different types of information, for instance, to understand
where a DM discovery in current DD searches could be further
explored with mediator studies at the LHC, and where, among the
multitude of possible signals, collider searches might focus
effort.

In the following \hl{subsections}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Addition correct?**]}}, we outline a strategy adopted by the ATLAS and
CMS experiments when making comparisons with astrophysical
observations (e.g., where is a model consistent with the present
DM density in the Universe) and with DD and ID results. We discuss the
assumptions made in the relic density calculation and in relating
reactions for {\IP}s to reactions of DM.

\subsection{Comparing LHC Constraints from Visible and Invisible \textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: OK\ to insert ``Particle'' here?**]}}Searches with Noncollider Results}

The collider results from ATLAS and CMS typically appear as constraints
on production cross sections of specific processes, which are then
interpreted as statements about the fundamental parameters of a
simplified model (e.g., masses, couplings). Within the model,
information about the parameters can then be extrapolated to
statements about the noncollider observable of interest---for
example, the WIMP--nucleon scattering cross section for DD searches or the
thermal relic density. The LHC Dark
Matter Working Group \cite{Boveia:2016mrp} has provided an in-depth discussion of how to
perform these extrapolations. Recently, most general LHC search
results have selected a single, specific set of BSM-mediated
simplified models for extrapolation, due to their immediate
relevance for the first 13-TeV collision data. But many other
models can be used,\footnote{For reinterpretation of LHC results
and their comparisons to DD and ID searches for scalar and pseudoscalar
mediators, as well as in the context of 2HDMs, see, for example, References~\citen{Bell:2016ekl}, \citen{Athron:2017kgt}, and \citen{Banerjee:2017wxi}.} and
published searches typically provide some form of model-agnostic
results for this purpose.

For example, CMS has extrapolated the parameter exclusions
obtained by a recent set of searches to the spin-independent
WIMP--nucleon cross section of a DD experiment. The
result is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:SICMS}, which shows a selection of DD results
for comparison. The figure illustrates general features of
many such comparisons. For spin-dependent DD scattering, such as an axial-vector-mediated model, the LHC signals are relatively insensitive to the Lorentz structure of the interaction, while the DD signals are suppressed. As a result, the corresponding plots show that LHC searches play a more powerful role relative to the DD searches over a wide range of invisible-particle masses. At intermediate DM masses,
both LHC and DD experiments have great potential for a discovery
and could verify one another's claims. For spin-dependent DD
scattering (e.g., an axial-vector-mediated model), because the LHC
signals are relatively insensitive to the Lorentz structure of the
interaction while the DD signals are suppressed, similar plots
show that LHC searches play a more powerful role relative to the
DD searches over a wide range of invisible-particle masses.

One can also compare collider and ID results using
simplified model benchmarks. In traditional comparisons, only one
DM annihilation state at a time was used for the comparison
of collider and ID results, as in the case for $b\bar{b}$ (e.g., \citen{Agrawal:2014una}), but one can also compare ID and
LHC results for models annihilating to multiple final-state
fermions~\cite{Carpenter:2016thc}.

Recently, some DD and ID collaborations have adopted the benchmark
simplified models used by ATLAS and CMS (e.g.,
\citen{PhysRevLett.118.251301,Balazs:2017hxh}). IceCube and other
experiments have used constraints from a MSSM scan (e.g.,~\citen{Aartsen:2016zhm}). The pMSSM is also a good framework
to highlight the complementarity of LHC, DD, and ID experiments (as shown in, e.g.,
Reference~\citen{Cahill-Rowley:2014twa} and discussed \hl{later}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: In which section(s) specifically?**]}}).

\begin{marginnote}[]
\entry{The LHC Dark Matter Working Group}{provides for the
translation of LHC limits to DD and ID searches~\cite{Boveia:2016mrp},
as well as calculations of relic density
(see \url{https://gitlab.cern.ch/lhc-dmwg-material/relic-density})}
\end{marginnote}

We emphasize that the exclusion regions obtained in this
way will depend strongly on the assumption of the model. The
extrapolations are done with full knowledge that the simplified
model is merely a crude guess, and one must be careful not to
overgeneralize. Neither this procedure nor the
simplified models themselves account for effects outside the
model, such as interference and mixing with SM boson and quarkonia
resonances, or the evolution of the operators in the model from
the LHC collision energies to other energy
scales~\cite{DEramo:2014nmf}. Moreover, all experimental results,
be they from DD, ID, or collider searches, are affected by experimental and
theoretical uncertainties that are not displayed \hl{here}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: In Figure 6?**]}}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Relic Density Considerations}

In the absence of a signal in noncollider experiments, the ability of a
model to link its {\IP}s with the observed DM abundance is key to
distinguishing it from other types of models of BSM\ physics. Making this link, however, requires extrapolating
from the present day to the early Universe along an increasingly
tenuous chain of assumptions. For simplified models, this is
especially problematic, because the model is designed to describe
collider-scale processes; it may not even contain the interactions
relevant in the early Universe. Nevertheless, it is interesting to
examine the parameter regions in models that can make the link, even if in limited
situations~\cite{Busoni:2014gta,Catena:2017xqq}. For example, for
the general simplified models discussed in
Section~\ref{sub:simplifiedModels}, one can use programs
such as MadDM and
MicrOMEGas~\cite{Backovic:2015cra,Barducci:2016pcb} to compute  the DM
abundance for a standard thermal relic, assuming that the
interaction described by the simplified model is the one
responsible for setting the relic density. Often (e.g.,
Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivityComparison}), ATLAS and CMS supplement
their results with contours indicating where within a model this
procedure obtains the correct DM density of $\omega_c =
0.12 h^2$. When the model cannot reproduce the correct abundance indicates either that  the model requires additional
components beyond those included in the simplified model or that
the chain of assumptions is incorrect~\cite{Bernal:2017kxu}.

\section{FUTURE EVOLUTION OF COLLIDER SEARCHES AND CONCLUSIONS}\label{sec:05_Future}

\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: OK\ to call this section ``CONCLUSION'' and move the very last paragraph of the article here?\ Per house style, the Future Issues should consist only of numbered sentences**]}}Here we highlight some areas to watch in the coming decade of
dark matter searches at colliders.

\begin{issues}[FUTURE ISSUES]
\begin{enumerate}

\item The obvious directions for LHC searches are toward lower-rate
processes and processes that are more difficult to detect.

\begin{itemize}

\item For such processes, extended scalar sectors and electroweak SUSY
are among the possible benchmarks. As Run 2 progresses, LHC searches
are becoming sensitive to the simplest (pseudo-)scalar simplified
models, opening the door to more realistic models. On a longer
timescale, the HL-LHC data set will bring sensitivity up to 3
TeV in scalar mediator masses for unit
couplings~\cite{CMS-PAS-FTR-16-005} and precision knowledge of the
SM Higgs sector\hl{, e.g., at the level of 10},\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Is a unit missing here?**]}} and the mass reach for
electroweak production of SUSY partners will increase by a few hundred
GeV~\cite{Campana:2016cqm}.

\item With data arriving at a slightly less frantic pace, experimentally
challenging LLP signatures are a growing field,
and benchmarks similar to Reference~\citen{Abercrombie:2015wmb} are
needed to help guide the design of these searches. Among many
ongoing efforts are the bottom-up approach adopted in
Reference \citen{Buchmueller:2017uqu}, which connects such models with
the LLP limit of those described in
Section~\ref{sub:simplifiedModels}.

\end{itemize}

\item Precision searches and efficient triggering of rare signals buried
in large backgrounds are key to fully exploiting the HL-LHC data set.
LHCb will make use of a novel triggerless detector readout to
perform dark photon searches at unprecedented
sensitivities~\cite{Ilten:2016tkc}. Such efforts should
inspire ATLAS and CMS to search for rare processes involving
relatively light new particles, a subject that has been largely
unexplored~\cite{Alves:2016cqf}. In the familiar jet+\MET search,
precision estimates of the \textit{V}+jet backgrounds, and of the inputs to
these predictions, will be crucial. Efforts in that
direction are ongoing \cite{Blumenschein:2018gtm}.

\item Future hadron and electron--positron colliders have immense
potential [see, e.g., studies on a future hadron
collider~\cite{Golling:2016gvc}]. Nevertheless, present studies
largely continue the approaches already in use at the LHC. A new
hadron collider would be built to discover New Physics\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**AU: Capitalization of New Physics OK?**]}};
therefore, qualitatively different experimental design, benchmark
models, and analysis strategies should be considered.

\item More useful working comparisons between results from colliders,
underground searches, and observatories should take into account
the uncertainties on each type of result, and on the
extrapolations between them. The main uncertainties for LHC
searches are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:03_ExperimentalResults} and in the experimental
references; for a summary of DD and ID uncertainties, see
References~\citen{Feldstein:2014ufa} and \citen{d300ef23986a49099715e661295a4d72} and
references therein.

\item Comparisons among collider and noncollider particle physics
experiments are becoming standard; relating particle physics to
astrophysical observables is crucial to exploit the few clues that
DM can provide about BSM\ particle physics. We
strongly encourage further research on this subject (e.g.,
\citen{Buckley:2017ijx}).
\end{enumerate}
\end{issues}

We are optimistic that the variety of powerful searches for
particle DM, from collider approaches to underground
experiments to observatories, will lead to much progress toward its discovery
in the next decade.\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: given that it might not be discovered, how about -- ``the next decade will lead to much progress toward its eventual discovery."
**]}} At colliders, the tools essential for
discovering and understanding the fundamental particles of the
SM\ are being applied. Our understanding of
collider search targets is also rapidly improving. Along with SUSY
benchmarks motivated by the hierarchy problem, targets directly
motivated by DM observations are encouraging a new generation of
experimentalists to branch out into directions that so far have been only
sparsely explored. Finally, the LHC is just beginning to
take data at a new  collision energy of 13~TeV\textbf{\textcolor{red}{[**REVIEWER\ COMMENT: given that we have had three years at 13 TeV and now we are in the fourth year, ``just beginning" is not justified.  Please refer to the beginning of accumulating the full luminosity expected until the end of its operation.**]}}, with the goal of a
data set that will exceed that presented here by a factor of 100. These
are exciting times.
