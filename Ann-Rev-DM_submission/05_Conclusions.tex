We are optimistic that, from collider approaches to underground experiments to observatories, the variety of powerful searches for particle dark matter will make much progress toward its discovery in the next decade.
At colliders, the tools essential to discovering and understanding the fundamental particles of the Standard Model are once again being applied.
Our understanding of collider search targets is also rapidly improving.
Along with SUSY benchmarks motivated by the hierarchy problem, targets directly motivated by DM observations are encouraging a new generation of experimentalists to branch out into directions that so far are sparsely explored.
Finally, the LHC is just at the beginning to take data at a new 13~TeV collision energy, with the goal of a dataset that exceeds that presented here by a factor of 100.
These are exciting times.
