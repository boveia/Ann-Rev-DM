Dark matter (DM) is perhaps the most persuasive experimental evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics~\cite{Bertone:2016nfn}. 
If DM is indeed a particle~\cite{Steigman:1979kw}, it has gravitational interactions with normal matter.
It may have other, non-gravitational interactions, but these are relatively rare---dark matter is dark and has no electromagnetic charge.
It is also stable, or at least it decays with a lifetime comparable to that of the universe.
Finally, there is {\it a lot} of DM, about five times the standard matter (SM) described by the Standard Model of particle physics, with plenty of room to exceed the SM in its complexity.
The current abundance of dark matter in the universe, derived from measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background~\cite{Ade:2015xua}, is one of the few quantitative measures of DM, or indeed of any physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The main consequences of cosmological observations for particle dark matter are listed in the Sidebar.

The field of particle physics is increasingly keen to understand what Dark Matter (DM) is, if it is indeed a particle. 
Some experiments, termed Direct Detection (DD) experiments, look for galactic DM colliding with underground targets made of Standard Model matter (SM)~\cite{0954-3899-43-1-013001}.
Others, termed Indirect Detection (ID) experiments, search for the products of annihilating dark matter concentrated within the gravitational potential wells of the Milky Way and elsewhere~\cite{Gaskins:2016cha}.
None of these experiments has yet found conclusive evidence of DM.
If the only interaction between DM and SM matter is gravitational, experiments will never see it.
Yet the search for particle DM started relatively recently, and plenty of room for optimism remains.

Colliders, one of the most successful tools of particle physics, have revealed much about SM matter.
This review will sketch how colliders contribute to the search for DM, focusing on the highest-energy collider currently in operation, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
Absent hints for the character of DM-SM interactions, it emphasizes what could be observed in the near future, the main experimental challenges presented, and how collider searches fit into the broader field.
Finally, it underlines a few areas to watch for the future LHC program.
