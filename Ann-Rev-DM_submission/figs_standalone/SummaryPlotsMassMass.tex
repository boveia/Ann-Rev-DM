Regions in dark matter mass--\Zprime mediator mass excluded at 95\% CL by a selection of ATLAS dark matter searches for two coupling scenarios. Dashed curves labeled "thermal relic" indicate combinations of dark matter and mediator mass that are consistent with a dark matter density of $\omega_c = 0.12 h^2$ and a standard thermal history, as computed in MadDM for this model~\cite{Backovic:2015cra}. The dotted curve indicates the kinematic threshold where the mediator can decay on-shell into dark matter. From~\cite{ATLASSummary}.
