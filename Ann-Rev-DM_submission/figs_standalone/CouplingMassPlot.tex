Summary of constraints from searches for light dijet resonances from ATLAS and CMS, where discrete points are taken from the coupling-mass limits on a simplified model mediated by an axial-vector $Z^\prime$ coupling exclusively to quarks from the searches mentioned in the text, and interpolated at the crossings. Couplings above the lines are excluded at 95\% CL, up to the values where larger couplings yield a resonance width larger than 15\% (roughly \gq $>$ 0.5).  
Pre-LHC constraints have been taken from~\cite{Dobrescu:2013coa}.
