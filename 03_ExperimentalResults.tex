Now that we have a handle on the reactions of DM observable at collider experiments, we turn to a description of the searches and experimental constraints for DM at colliders, privileging LHC searches as they generally set the most stringent constraints. For a detailed description of the LHC and the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments, we refer to~\cite{LHC2008,ATLAS2008,CMS2008}. %CD: blurb more? I'd say no. 
The first period of LHC running (2010-2012) at 7 and 8 TeV center-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s}$) is termed Run-1, while the second period (2015-2018) is called Run-2. 
The categorization of these searches follows loosely the description of the benchmark models. We start describing searches for DM interacting through SM bosons~\ref{sec:results_ZHSearches}, then move to generic searches for signals with missing transverse momentum~\ref{sec:results_monoXSearches}, and outline the searches for complete models with DM candidates in Section~\ref{sec:results_SUSYSearches}. Throughout this chapter and in Section~\ref{sec:experimentalChallenges} we will highlight the experimental challenges and the novel experimental techniques used to overcome them, motivated by the strong interest in dark matter searches. 
We then conclude with searches for long-lived particles within models of DM in
Section~\ref{sec:results_LLPSearches}. %CD: need to rewrite this sentence, but the idea is: if we hadn't had DM as a motivation motivation we wouldn't have done this difficult stuff. 

\subsection{Searches for DM in interactions mediated by SM-boson}
\label{sec:results_ZHSearches}

The invisible decays of the Z and Higgs boson are the main direct targets of searches for SM-boson-mediated interactions between SM and DM particles, if the DM particle is lighter than half the mass of the boson. Above this region, Direct Detection experiments are generally more sensitive than collider experiments. 
%CD: do we need to answer "what if not"? No one seems to care, but one could maybe think of using monojet off-shell (tiny tiny region) and precision constraints for the off-shell region too, a la dijet. Main point for the moment: DD covers this region so we don't have to. 
In the SM, the Z boson can decay to a pair of neutrinos, while the Higgs boson decays into a pair of Z bosons each decaying to neutrinos. Additional decays of the Z and Higgs boson to particles beyond the SM modify the properties of the vector boson, such as width and couplings. 

%MonoZ

%CD only mentioning below because it's like a monophoton
%Simple (but somehow messy) explanation in https://cds.cern.ch/record/1750933/files/CERN-THESIS-2013-330.pdf, Hugo's student
%Hugo did it, unpublished: https://www-cdf.fnal.gov/physics/ewk/2007/ZnunuWidth/
%CDF direct: 466 pm 42
\textbf{Decays of the Z boson into invisible particles} can be constrained using the invisible Z width. It can be measured directly in Z decays in association with a photon emitted as initial state radiation. Events are selected containing a single photon, missing transverse momentum and no other sizable event activity. This selection is also used for identifying events from possible DM reactions at colliders.
%LEP combined: 503 $\pm$ 16 MeV
The total Z width has been measured indirectly at LEP~\cite{ALEPH:2005ab} leading to a measurement of the number of light neutrino families compatible with cosmology; if the partial widths of the decays into visible particles are subtracted from the total width, the invisible width can be measured to 499.1 $\pm$ 1.5 MeV~\cite{Patrignani:2016xqp}. 
%The precision of the indirect measurement is better than that of the direct measurement, due to the higher statistics and the relative ease of selection and background subtraction for the visible Z decays. %CD: omitted, no space
%The main systematic uncertainty in this case comes from the theoretical uncertainties in the simulation. CD: Carena seems to think it is an uncertainty on fast simulation
New physics effects modify direct and/or indirect Z width~\cite{Carena:2003aj}.
\begin{marginnote}[]
Direct and indirect Z width measurements must agree if the decay of the Z to a pair of invisible new particles is to be the main mechanism responsible for the deviation from the SM values. 
\end{marginnote}%CD: I think this is important to mention in the same sense as the caveats on the s-channel resonances, but it can be omitted
%in this case, an analysis of the mass of the system recoiling against the photon would provide a handle to distinguish between different BSM processes. %CD: omitted because this is possibly too handwavy but how can we summarize 4 pages of Carena in a sentence?
%Carena quantitative: At present, measurements at LEP and CHARM II are capable of constraining the left-handed Z\nu\nu-coupling, 0.45 <~ g_L <~ 0.5,  while the right-handed one is only mildly bounded, |g_R| <= 0.2.
The LEP precision measurements~\footnote{Bounds on Z to invisible decays obtained from LHC searches are not yet competitive~\cite{deSimone:2014pda}.}, as well as direct detection experiments, rule out the majority of the Z-mediated DM scenarios~\cite{Arcadi:2014lta,Escudero:2016gzx}. The LEP invisible width is well below the width one would expect if vector and axial vector models of DM were realized, for all couplings satisfying the relic density with a DM mass below 25 GeV. Direct detection experiments such as Xenon1T~\cite{Aprile:2017iyp} 
%CD: take figure 2 of Escudero:2016gzx and compare with the results of Aprile:2017iyp
rule out most of the other simplified model scenarios compatible with freeze-out relic density up to multi-TeV DM masses. 
%DM mass above 6 TeV for the vector couplings, while for axial the plot is truncated. 

%%MonoH

\textbf{Invisible decays of the H boson} within the SM only contribute to less than 0.1\% of the total decay width. For this reason, an observation of even a small contribution to the Higgs width from invisible particles would signal the presence of new physics phenomena that could be linked to DM if 2\mdm $< m_H$~\footnote{For the case of heavier DM particles, see Ref.~\cite{Djouadi:2011aa}.}. 

Pre-LHC constraints on the invisible Higgs width are derived from measurements of the ZH production channel at LEP in searches for new neutral Higgs-like bosons, where only the visible decays of the Z are observed. This is a common procedure to select events in LHC DM searches. %CD: need a number! 
It is not feasible to directly or indirectly measure the total and partial Higgs widths at a hadron collider and then extract the invisible contribution as done for the Z at LEP, as some of the decays (e.g. gluons and lighter quarks) have too large a background to be measured, the experimental resolution even for leptonic decays is large compared to the intrinsic Higgs SM width, and the kinematics of the ZH process is not fully determined as in lepton colliders. %CD: this is ambiguous also because I am not sure I fully understand the first and third points completely - need AB's help, page 2 of Dobrescu/Lykken. 
%Lykken/Dobrescu, 1210.3342: Total theoretical SM width/mass for H125: 3.2 * 10^-5 MeV, due to small Yukawa of b quark and suppression of WW*. From rates and couplings,  can extract upper and lower limits on the exotic Higgs branching fractions, which come from the upper/lower limit on the total width. This paper ignores exp uncertainties. 
%Wagner Dark Side of the Higgs boson: omit because we don't care about non-SM Higgses
%The width can be extracted from the lineshape in the low-background channel $Z \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4l$, assuming a SM width. This is what CMS has done. 
%If one does not want to assume the SM width, one can still extract the width
%above 190 GeV where the experimental resolution is better. 
%what we want to see is a larger total width with less normalization because of the invisible decays
Instead, searches at the LHC either attempt to directly observe the invisible decays of the Higgs boson, or compare measurements with precise theoretical calculations of SM parameters, to reveal
%unearth? there are no worms in this article so we should change this word
discrepancies signaling new physics or indirectly place constraints on new physics phenomena. 
Higgs to invisible LHC searches using Run-1 and Run-2 data~\cite{Khachatryan:2016whc,Aad:2015pla} employ and combine the $qq \rightarrow H qq$, $qq \rightarrow VH$, $gg \rightarrow HZ$, $gg \rightarrow Hg$ Higgs production modes. 
%CD: This section is just CMS for now. Need to add ATLAS, but also cut as we're using too much space for this:
%https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2015-03/fig_09.png
In all cases, in addition to a requirement of sizable missing transverse momentum, auxiliary visible objects are used to select the events. 
%Loop-induced signals are important. 
%For more info on importance and calculation of loops: 1605.08039, but we run out of citations and space
The events are divided in exclusive categories targeting specific production modes. The associated boson (VH) searches target the decays of Z bosons to electrons, muons light or heavy flavour quarks, while the W bosons can decay into light-flavour jets. 
The $qq \rightarrow H qq$ production mode is dominated by Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) processes, where the Higgs boson is produced in association with two hadronic jets that have a large pseudorapidity ($\eta$)
%CD: assume eta?
separation in the detector, and a large invariant mass. This topology is used to select events and discriminate between signal and background. 
%The large QCD backgrounds are suppressed by requiring that the missing transverse momentum recoils against the jets in the event. 
%If the missing transverse momentum was in the direction of the jets, there would be a chance of it coming from mismeasured jets. %CD: hmmm written this in a rush
The jet+MET search, described in more detail in the next section, is reinterpreted for the $gg \rightarrow Hg$ mode. 

%The upper limit on the invisible BR from Higgs decays is 25%. 
%ATLAS Abstract
%Direct searches for invisible Higgs boson decays in the vector-boson fusion and associated production of a Higgs boson with W/Z (Z ? ??, W/Z ? jj) modes are statistically combined to set an upper limit on the Higgs boson invisible branching ratio of 0.25. The use of the measured visible decay rates in a more general coupling fit improves the upper limit to 0.23, constraining a Higgs portal model of dark matter.
%%Precision
Precision measurements of the Higgs boson properties and the comparison with SM theory also play a role in constraining the possible contributions to new physics, as decays into invisible particles would reduce the SM Higgs production and decay coupling strengths~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau,Englert:2011yb,Aad:2015pla}. 
%For the Higgs boson, the upper limit on the branching fraction to visible and/or invisible non-SM particles only using precision measurements is 34\%
%In case we want to say what limits these
%The main limitation for the measurement of the invisible width of the Higgs at the LHC is due to QCD uncertainties the Higgs production cross-section, which limits the sensitivity of these searches to roughly 10\% of the SM value. 

The most stringent observed upper limit on the fraction of invisible decays of the Higgs boson, combining direct and precision measurements is 23\%.
%What does it mean for Higgs portal models: DD is always better
In the case of light fermion DM with scalar couplings to the Higgs, direct detection experiment rule out most of the parameter space where the model can provide the measured relic density~\cite{Escudero:2016gzx,Djouadi:2011aa}. Due to the suppression of the cross-section for DD in the pseudoscalar case, the model is still not constrained around a small region for DM masses corresponding to half the Higgs mass and above. %CD: maybe we have to say why this is the case - essentially rates are too small, see paper by Plehn. 

\subsection{Generic searches for DM with missing transverse momentum}
\label{sec:results_monoXSearches}

%For the 8 TeV dataset, an additional requirement is set on an approximate missing transverse energy significance variable S(Emiss) defined as the ratio of Emiss to the square root of the scalar sum of the transverse energy of all PF objects in the event [62]. Selected events are required to satisfy S(Emiss) > 4?GeV.

%%%Bunch of text from ERC that could be useful for TLA part

%This is what I wrote in ERC, not sure if it's usable
%Not knowing the exact nature of these new particles, it is not possible
%to pin down at which energy scales they are going to be produced, 
%and at which rates. This calls for generic searches that are sensitive 
%to a broad range of theoretical benchmarks, and whose results can be easily
%re-interpreted in different frameworks. The absence of any New Physics discoveries 
%during the first LHC run also points to the need for the study of more elaborate 
%and rare processes that can only be achieved with new analysis techniques. 

%At the LHC, proton beams with a center of mass energy of 13 \tera\electronvolt \ will collide up to 
%every 25 \nano\second \ at the four interaction points, where experiments are installed. 
%The ATLAS (\textbf{A} \textbf{T}oroidal \textbf{L}HC \textbf{A}pparatu\textbf{S}) experiment 
%is a general purpose detector located at the Interaction Point 1.
%From the Spring of 2010 to Fall 2012 the LHC has recorded a total of 25 \invfb of collision data 
%at 7 and 8 \tera\electronvolt. 
%
%It is the high interaction rate of proton-proton collisions at the LHC that 
%allows the collection of the large dataset necessary to search for rare processes. 
%The design and operation of the ATLAS detector is described in 
%References~\cite{DetectorPaper}. The key subsystems employed in this projects are the calorimeters, 
%where energy deposits from the collimated sprays of particles originated by 
%quarks and gluons are detected. The energy deposits are used as inputs of 
%\textit{jet algorithms}~\cite{Salam:2009jx}: 
%the experimental output used for the analysis is a reconstructed jet that, after calibration, 
%contains information on the kinematics of the original physics process. 
%The system and technologies employed to select and collect interesting data are the crucial components for the 
%innovative Trigger Level Analysis searches outlined in WP2 and WP3, 
%and they are described in more detail in Section~\ref{subsub:datacollection}. 
%
%The LHC will restart operations in Summer 2015, increasing the center of mass energy to 13 TeV. 
%The dataset collected over the course of the planned three years of operations (called \textit{Run 2}, 
%ongoing until mid-2018) corresponds to 100 \invpb~\cite{KEKRossi}. 
%Upgrades to further increase the data rate and the center of mass energy to 14 TeV will be 
%undertaken during the course of 2016, and completed during the 1.5 year technical stop (called LS2).
%LS2 will last until the beginning of 2020, leading to the third LHC run 
%that will collect an additional 200 \invpb of data. 
%
%During LS2, the LHC experiments will undergo major upgrades to their hardware (called Phase-I upgrades). 
%In the final two years of this project that coincide with the LHC Run 3, 
%I will exploit the new gFEX trigger board~\cite{Bartoldus:1602235} to extend the Trigger-Level Analysis 
%method to obtain an increased sensitivity for four-jet final states. 
%
%\subsubsection{Data collection and data analysis in ATLAS at the LHC}
%\label{subsub:datacollection}
%
%The data rate delivered by the LHC (up to 40 million collisions per second in nominal conditions) exceeds the 
%current capabilities for recording events offline, both in terms of recording speed and storage space. 
%The rare signal events sought are buried in an overwhelming number of background events.
%It is therefore necessary to have a \textit{trigger} system that in a very short timescale 
%selects the interesting collision events based on the presence of high transverse momentum physics objects 
%(muons, electrons, photons, jets and tau leptons). 
%
%The ATLAS data collection rate at the end of the trigger selection still surpasses other ``Big data'' 
%challenges both in academic research and in industry. 
%As an example, ATLAS and the three other main detectors at the LHC produced and recorded 
%13 petabytes of data just in 2010~\cite{NaturePetabyte}. It is clear
%that with such large dataset new ideas and new analysis techniques are needed,
%especially in the case of small deviations over large backgrounds. 
%One such idea consists of moving the data analysis as close
%to the data taking as possible, ultimately removing the need for storage at all. 
%This proposal moves the first steps for the ATLAS detector in this direction, 
%proposing to only retain a subset of the event information, and eventually 
%to move an entire search to be done in real-time as soon as the data
%is collected. 
%
%\paragraph{The ATLAS Trigger system}
%
%The ATLAS trigger system is subdivided in two levels: Level-1 and High Level Trigger (HLT)
%The first, fast selection is made at L1 using coarse detector information. 
%Its logic is mostly hardwired in the readout electronics, 
%given that the decision needs to be made in less than 2.5 $\mu$ \second. 
%The bandwidth available for data transfer to the HLT and the HLT computing power
%limit the rate that could be accepted by the L1 to 75 kHZ from the initial 40 MHz 
%provided by the LHC~\cite{Sfyrla:1510140}. The events accepted by the L1 trigger 
%are passed on to the HLT trigger, a software subsystem. The longer latency allows 
%to perform a more refined reconstruction of the objects that are used for the selection.
%Jets reconstructed within the HLT system will be called \textit{trigger jets} in the following,
%while \textit{offline jets} are those reconstructed after the event has passed the full trigger chain.
%During the 2012 data taking, ATLAS recorded and reconstructed data at a rate of 
%400 Hz, leaving an additional 200 Hz of recorded data for later reconstruction
%(\textit{delayed} data).  
%
%Since the rate for certain signatures (e.g. multi-jet events that are backgrounds of the 
%searches outlined in this proposal) would saturate the limited bandwidth that needs to be shared 
%by all triggers, some triggers are \textit{prescaled}. 
%This means that only a fraction of the events accepted 
%are effectively passed onto the next level.
%A prescale of 1 means that all events 
%selected by the trigger are accepted, while larger prescales mean that only a fraction 
%1/prescale is accepted. This in turn harms the sensitivity of searches, as signal events
%will be rejected by the trigger system as well. 

%Blurb from ERC

%Hadronic jets are a particularly promising final state for both the Dark Matter mediators 
%produced at the LHC, but also for new, unknown particles that might be created when crossing 
%the threshold of a new energy scale such as in the upcoming LHC run. 
%Not knowing the exact nature of these new particles, it is not possible
%to pin down at which energy scales they are going to be produced, 
%and at which rates. This calls for generic searches that are sensitive 
%to a broad range of theoretical benchmarks, and whose results can be easily
%re-interpreted in different frameworks. The absence of any New Physics discoveries 
%during the first LHC run also points to the need for the study of more elaborate 
%and rare processes that can only be achieved with new analysis techniques. 

%A wide range of theoretical models attempt to incorporate Dark Matter. 
%Many of these models postulate the presence of a new massive subatomic particle
%that interacts only feebly with SM particles as a Dark Matter candidate.
%The presence of these Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) can be inferred in 
%in a variety of experiments. \textit{Direct Detection} 
%experiments detect the interaction between an incoming 
%Dark Matter particle and target nuclei within the detector, by measuring nucleon recoil.
%\textit{Indirect Detection} experiments detect the fluxes of SM particles that 
%are produced from the annihilation of DM particles~\cite{Bertone:2004pz, Bauer:2013ihz}. 
%Dark Matter searches at colliders are supported by the consistency
%of the thermal relic density and the annihilation rates of WIMP candidates with masses
%in the GeV-TeV range, compatible with the energy regime of the LHC~\cite{Bertone:2004pz}. 
%The complementarity of those searches in terms of the WIMP-SM interaction of interest 
%is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:complementarity} (a-c).

%~\cite{PhysRevLett.113.121101} and DAMA~\cite{Bernabei:2003za}
%have observed tantalizing signals 
%with a possible Dark Matter explanation.
%There some tension between direct detection experiments: the signal-like excesses 
%and characteristics of events in the CDMS and CoGENT experiments~\cite{Agnese:2013rvf,Hooper:2010uy}
%are not confirmed by other experiments such as LUX~\cite{Akerib:2013tjd}. 
%
%The flagship searches for Dark Matter at the LHC and at the Tevatron 
%exploit the recoil of undetected pair-produced WIMPs against a jet radiated 
%by one of the initial-state quarks or gluons. Such searches have yet to find 
%evidence for WIMPs (see e.g. Refs. ~\cite{Aad:2013oja,ATLAS:2014wra,Aad:2014vka,Aad:2014vea,Aad:2014tda,ATLAS-CONF-2012-147}

%Results from all these experiments need to be connected in a coherent framework for a
