As described in the previous chapter, DM itself is not visible at colliders and has
to be observed indirectly in association with other visible particles. 

Signals of DM can come from MonoX and diX searches. 

State of the art MC:

Vector and scalar models are known at NLO~\cite{Neubert:2015fka,Haisch:2013ata}
NLO corrections for vector and scalar models in monoZ and monojet

t-channel

From Millie's talk (see Reaction OmniOutliner):
Since the DM-mediator-quark vertices allow for simultaneous FS partons with different hard scale, particular prescription needs to be used for the generation of samples with different partons that splits samples in number of mediators. Interference between the diagrams is neglected following Papucci et al.
