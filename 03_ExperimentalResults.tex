%many ways in which the models of previous section would manifest: effects in
%- astrophysics (only way, if dark matter only interacts gravitationally)
%- particle physics (underground, fixed target, and colliders)

The interactions described in the previous chapter have many consequences in astrophysics (where they could modify the DM density) and in collider and non-collider particle physics experiments.% such as underground DD experiments, fixed target experiments and detectors at particle colliders, where non-gravitational interactions must play a role. 
%why colliders (what is a collider)
%- high energy
%- very well-understood detectors 
%- not able to prove non-interacting particles are invisible particles but
%- discover/study other mediators and other particles in dark sector, not just invisible particles
%why lhc (what is the LHC)
%- interactions may be feeble because because mediator is heavy, or because couplings to SM are small
%- highest energy, able to probe highest energy scales of any collider
%- largest luminosity for hadron-hadron collisions, can reach small couplings
%- complementarity: effective coupling to hadrons required for production in pp collisions, also required for nuclear scattering in DD

Collisions of known particles at high energy, observed with well-understood detectors, have been a very successful tool, leading to the discovery of many of the fundamental components of known matter in the SM. %link is completely missing here
While collider experiments alone cannot discover DM, they can discover invisible particles, and this could open up direct study of DM--SM mediators in other channels and additional particles of a dark sector. %this essentially means we are free from astroparticle uncertainties, more explicit?
DM--SM interactions may be feeble because they are mediated by a heavy mediator or by a mediator with small couplings to SM.
High energy and large numbers of collisions are needed to probe for these interactions, and the LHC, which presently collides protons at a center-of-mass energy of 13~TeV, will deliver both in the coming years. 
%The LHC, which presently collides protons at a center-of-mass energy of 13~TeV, is the highest-energy collider in operation.

Below we discuss experimental searches for invisible particles from three LHC experiments, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb~\cite{ATLAS2008,CMS2008,LHC2008} and briefly touch on some results from previous colliders. %does ALICE search for invisible particles?
The LHC results include up to 36~\ifb of proton-proton data taken through 2017 during Run-2, more than three times what used for the Higgs discovery, but only 1\% of the data expected during the full High Luminosity (HL-LHC) run.

For signature, we outline how the relevant searches are done, some the challenges, and the information they provide on the properties of hypothetical particles (couplings, mediator mass, other parameters of the Lagrangian in a particular model). 
In a later chapter, we describe how collider information can be related to non-collider DM searches and to the present DM abundance, such as how conclusions drawn from relativistic collisions can be extrapolated to the non-relativistic collisions of DM+nucleons.

%\textbf{Decays of the Z boson into invisible particles} can be constrained using the invisible Z width. It can be measured directly in Z decays in association with a photon emitted as initial state radiation. Events are selected containing a single photon, missing transverse momentum and no other sizable event activity. This selection is also used for identifying events from possible invisible particles reactions at colliders.
%LEP combined: 503 $\pm$ 16 MeV
%The total Z width has been measured indirectly at LEP~\cite{ALEPH:2005ab} leading to a measurement of the number of light neutrino families compatible with cosmology; if the partial widths of the decays into visible particles are subtracted from the total width, the invisible width can be measured to 499.1 $\pm$ 1.5 MeV~\cite{Patrignani:2016xqp}. 
%The precision of the indirect measurement is better than that of the direct measurement, due to the higher statistics and the relative ease of selection and background subtraction for the visible Z decays. %CD: omitted, no space
%The main systematic uncertainty in this case comes from the theoretical uncertainties in the simulation. CD: Carena seems to think it is an uncertainty on fast simulation
%\begin{marginnote}[]
%Direct and indirect Z width measurements must agree if the decay of the Z to a pair of invisible new particles is to be the main mechanism responsible for the deviation from the SM values. 
%\end{marginnote}%CD: I think this is important to mention in the same sense as the caveats on the s-channel resonances, but it can be omitted
%in this case, an analysis of the mass of the system recoiling against the photon would provide a handle to distinguish between different BSM processes. %CD: omitted because this is possibly too handwavy but how can we summarize 4 pages of Carena in a sentence?
%Carena quantitative: At present, measurements at LEP and CHARM II are capable of constraining the left-handed Z\nu\nu-coupling, 0.45 <~ g_L <~ 0.5,  while the right-handed one is only mildly bounded, |g_R| <= 0.2.

For copious production of low-mass invisible particles, colliders already provide spectacular evidence: the huge rate of neutrino production mediated by the W and Z bosons. 
Neutrino production via the Z boson is often the largest background to searches for new invisible particles and is important to understand well.
The rate of would differ from the SM prediction if the Z boson is coupled to additional invisible particles lighter than about half its mass.
The most precise measurement of the invisible Z width, 499.1 $\pm$ 1.5 MeV~\cite{Patrignani:2016xqp}, has been inferred from the total width at LEP~\cite{ALEPH:2005ab}.
This can be used to constrain the parameters of models such as Z portals~\cite{Carena:2003aj,Arcadi:2014lta,Escudero:2016gzx}.
The coupling between the Z and an invisible Dirac fermion is constrained to be smaller than 2-3\% for invisible particles that are significantly lighter than half the Z mass.
A less-precise direct measurement of the Z's invisible width, also by LEP, uses invisible decays with a photon emitted as initial state radiation (ISR), selecting events with a single photon, the total invisible transverse momentum inferred from momentum balance with the visible particles (\MET), and little other event activity.
This \MET+ISR has become a key signature for invisible particle searches at colliders. 
At the LHC, precision measurements continue to test the production and decay of Z bosons for the effects of invisible particles. 
For example, ATLAS has measured the ratio of cross sections for jet and \MET production, dominated by invisibly-decaying Z bosons, to production of Z bosons decaying to dilepton pairs, a ratio which is sensitive to the production of additional invisible particles~\cite{Aaboud:2017buf}. 

The Z boson is also key to invisible decays of the newly-discovered Higgs boson.
Higgs decays to neutrinos contribute to less than 0.1\% of its total decay width in the SM, proceeding through a pair of Z bosons that then both decay invisibly.
With present data, this rate could become observable if the Higgs is coupled to additional \IP~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau,Englert:2011yb,Aad:2015pla}.
%% its small width to invisible particles in the SM is far below current experimental sensitivity, so an observation of invisibly-decaying Higgs would imply new physics. 
To constrain the invisible width of the Higgs, ATLAS and CMS cannot directly measure its total width in a model-independent fashion\cite{Dobrescu:2012td}.
Searches instead attempt to directly observe these decays via their recoil against visible particles (substantial \MET), or by comparing measurements of the Higgs parameters under additional assumptions about the BSM physics.
Direct Higgs to invisible searches have used Run-1 and Run-2 data, combining several strong and electroweak production channels.
Combining direct and indirect searches, the most stringent bound on the fraction of invisible decays of the Higgs boson is 23\%~\cite{Khachatryan:2016whc,Aad:2015pla}.
This places constraints on Higgs portal couplings of 1-2\% for Dirac invisible particles much lighter than half the Higgs mass. 
%For the Higgs boson, the upper limit on the branching fraction to visible and/or invisible non-SM particles only using precision measurements is 34\%

\subsection{Generic searches for invisible particles from BSM mediation}
\label{sec:results_monoXSearches}

Searches for invisible decays via SM mediators (the Z or Higgs) can be viewed as special cases of searches for more general BSM mediation of invisible particles.
Since mediator decays to \IP are suppressed if the \IP mass is heavier than half the mediator mass, the fixed masses of SM mediators place a $\sim45$ --65~GeV upper bound on the \IP mass that can be observed.
Moreover, the distribution of \MET in such events has a similar shape to that of the Z-mediated neutrino background.
.% and known properties of Higgs and Z bosons are exploited to reject backgrounds.

\input{METSidebar}

For heavier BSM mediators, this is not necessarily the case.
Their decay to invisible particles can produce \MET distributions substantially different than the SM background.
The complexity of the processes mediating invisible particle production determines the composition of the visible recoil, and so searches are employed across many different visible particle signatures. 
Nevertheless, many collider searches, from LEP to Tevatron to the most recent LHC searches~\cite{Fox:2011fx,Beltran:2010ww,Bai:2010hh}, aim to be model-agnostic, designed to detect an excess of \MET over the SM background with minimal assumptions about the visible objects in the recoil.
Selecting events (triggering) in a model-agnostic way can often be done by looking for substantial \MET, but for models that do not produce large \MET, one is forced to assume more about the visible recoil.
We start with the 'jet+\MET' search, which illustrates techniques used in other general invisible particle searches, and shares with them many of the same challenges.
Traditionally, these have been called 'mono-X' searches, but the radiation of a single object is only the leading process in the simplest reactions~\cite{Haisch:2013ata}. 

%We begin this section by describing the LHC searches for missing transverse momentum in association with one or more hadronic jets. The jet+\MET search allows us to illustrate many of the techniques used in invisible particle searches, and it is one of the most powerful to constrain BSM-mediated simplified models of invisible particles. We then move on to outlining searches using different associated objects, and continue with searches for visible mediators that are the consequences of the invisible particles production mechanism. Finally, we compare and discuss the sensitivity of invisible invisible particles and visible mediator searches at the LHC.

\subsubsection{Searches with jets}

%- searches for invisible particles (where the interaction is mediated by another particle) all have a common denominator in the large Z + (stuff) to invisible SM background
%- for H and Z we know signature is relatively low MET
%- with BSM mediators, we don't: looking in different slices of phase space (different MET regions) with different associated particles (different signal/background ratios and sensitivity to particular operators)

%Can think of searches for H->invisible and Z->invisible as tailored instances of more generic searches where mediator can be whatever the fuck. Invisible signals for masses above 45-60-ish GeV; up to half mediator mass. So: much wider range of the amount of MET is possible. So while the H-invisble searches are tailored to a particular range of mediator masses (90-125 GeV), a more generic set of searches, often termed 'mono-X' searches, are performed to probe this wider variety of signatures found in the BSM mediator models.

One way to reduce the model dependence of the searches is to require that the recoiling visible particles are produced by SM processes, not in the dark interaction.
ISR meets this criteria.
SM bosons are likely to be present in any BSM process, radiated from initial state partons at rates fixed by the SM.
Because gluon ISR is far more prevalent than the other forms, the jet+\MET search is a key search in this approach.% particularly when the details of the dark interaction are unspecified.

A jet+\MET search typically selects collision events with a moderate amount of \MET (in the 13 TeV analyses, typically above 200 GeV, sufficient to record such events at a manageable rate) and at least one jet with transverse momentum, \pt, larger than 100-200 GeV in the central region of the detector ($\eta<2.4$). 
From this sample, further restrictions on additional hadronic jets and other visible particles are used to suppress contributions from SM processes and from instrumental backgrounds causing spurious \MET.
These requirements reduce the generality of the analysis but also better isolate signal-like events.
For example, contributions from W bosons decaying to leptons are reduced by vetoing events with leptons, and top pair production is reduced by limiting the number of jets present.
The remaining SM multi-jet processes can exhibit large \MET when one or more jets is mismeasured.
Such mismeasurements often result in \MET along the axis of a jet, and this feature is used to reduce the background to about 1\% of the total.
%$\phi$ direction of the missing transverse momentum vector does not align with the direction of the four-momentum of the jets with the highest \pt (leading jets).
%The remaining QCD background estimated from data amounts to less than 1\% of the total background. 
Non-collision events (e.g., intersecting cosmic rays, beam-gas interactions, and calorimeter problems) can also produce spurious \MET events.
Fig.~\ref{fig:fakeMET} shows that such events dominates a high \MET data sample unless rejected with criteria tailored to the expected collision time and detector hardware.%Sidebar? Textbox?

After the above criteria, one arrives at a sample composed mainly of invisible decays of the Z boson (approximately 55-70\% of the total background).
%CMS excludes taus, while ATLAS does not. Too much detail imo.

A substantial rate of semi-leptonic decays of the W boson also survives the lepton veto when the lepton is not reconstructed (approximately 20-35\% of the total background.

The main observable is typically the number of events in one or more \MET \textit{signal regions}, either exclusive (in bins of \MET) or inclusive (considering all events above a given \MET threshold).

%Searches for invisible particles presents different challenges, depending on the invisible particle mass and boost. If the mediator is heavy, any light invisible particle will receive a boost and appear as an excess in the tails of the SM \MET distribution. If instead the invisible  particle pair originates from a light mediator, of the same mass range as the Higgs boson, it will manifest itself at low \MET. The low \MET suffers from a much higher rate of both instrumental and SM backgrounds.
%As a consequence, it is impossible to record and store all events with a low-\MET for further analysis, since at the data-taking stage (within the \textit{trigger} and data acquisition systems) it is difficult to obtain further handles to discriminate signal and background, and the sensitivity to low-\MET signals is compromised. This challenge will be discussed further for both visible and invisible particle searches in Sec.~\ref{sub:twoBody}.

%- so predictions from available high order calculations are combined with data in the visible CR to blah.
%- combined means: use Zll as estimate of the shape, compare to MC, and correct for instrumental and other known effects.

Because \IP have feeble interactions with the colliding partons, and thus low production cross sections, these searches need very precises estimate of the shapes of the backgrounds.
%As an example, the integrated number of signal events with a \MET below 510 GeV amounts to less than 0.03\% of the background~\cite{Sirunyan:2017jix}.

A background estimate solely from MC simulation is subject to uncertainties on both theory and detector simulation affecting the total cross-sections and is therefore not precise enough.
To estimate the Z- and W-mediated neutrino backgrounds, recent ATLAS and CMS searches combine the information from data, in signal-free \textit{control regions} selecting visible boson+jet processes (W, Z, $\gamma$) and the most recent perturbative calculations~\cite{Lindert:2017olm}, much more precise estimates.
%The shape of the \MET distribution is taken from simulation, but its normalization is derived from data  
%where the transverse momentum of the visible decay products is subtracted from the total transverse momentum balance to obtain a proxy of the \MET distribution.

%not sure we should say that the bin by bin estimates are used, here it's ambiguous
%The event selection follows that of the signal region, substituting a lepton requirement to the lepton veto in case of vector bosons. 
%[Consider adding more info about QCD/QED correction and importance thereof, citing Ellis's paper on UA1 discovery~\cite{Ellis:159861}].
%The estimation of the number of $Z\rightarrow \nu\nu$events from the $\gamma$+jet and  $W\rightarrow l\nu$+jets control region needs a specific treatment due to the difference in the processes. This is particularly important for a consistent treatment of the different processes used in the background estimation and of the main theoretical uncertainties. %CD: how do we call the thing
%The full information on the theoretical and experimental uncertainties and their correlations from this procedure is used in a simultaneous fit to control and signal regions, to determine the overall background estimate in each of the \MET regions considered. 
%and leads to an improvement of 40 to 50% in the search according to PhilHarris and Livia, but I wouldn't add that unreferenced
Backgrounds from top processes in ATLAS are estimated using a control region with $b-$jets, while CMS takes this background from simulation.
Estimates of smaller backgrounds rely more heavily on simulation.
%Smaller diboson backgrounds are estimated solely from simulation. 

%%Experimental uncertainties
To date, precision achieved for the background estimate is 2--7\% (CMS) and 2--10\% (ATLAS), depending on the \MET range.
The remaining uncertainties mainly arise from the identification of leptons (CMS) and the understanding of the jet and \MET calibration (ATLAS).

%Model-independent
With no excesses observed, these searches can set 95\% CL limits on the production cross-section of invisible particles, typically spanning from 0.5\pb to 2\fb depending on the \MET threshold~\cite{Aaboud:2017phn}.
ATLAS and CMS also report constraints on a selection of mediator models.
These constraints can be interpreted as limits on the interactions between the mediator and the SM (e.g.\gq) under specific sets of model assumptions, not on the mass and other properties of the invisible particles per se.
As an example, for the simplified model with (axial-)vector mediators, mediator masses of up to 1.5--1.9~TeV~\cite{Aaboud:2017phn,Sirunyan:2017jix} are ruled out for an invisible coupling of \gdm=1. For lighter mediators than this bound, the search can exclude SM couplings of order 0.1, or alternatively lower \gdm values than unity.
With this amount of data, the searches are also becoming sensitive to lower-rate interactions mediated by (pseudo-)scalar mediators, and a recent ATLAS search~\cite{Aaboud:2017phn} sets explicit constraints on colored scalar mediators, where, for unit couplings and invisible particle masses of up to 100 GeV, the mass of the mediator is constrained to be above 1.7 TeV. 
Jet+\MET results from LHC Run-1 and the Tevatron have also reported constraints on EFT models.  

Since this type of searches can constrain a wider variety of interactions than explicitly considered, steps have been taken to allow easy reinterpretation of the results. 
ATLAS and CMS provide more detailed experimental results on the HEPData platform~\cite{Maguire:2017ypu}.
CMS also proivdes a simplified likelihood function encapsulating the result~\cite{Collaboration:2242860,Sirunyan:2017jix}.
%which under certain assumptions approximates the full likelihood using a reduced set of information, 
%and has been used for reinterpretation~\cite{Pobbe:2017wrj}.


\subsubsection{Searches with photons and vector bosons}
\label{subsub:monoV}
%monophoton, monoV

%What we wrote above
%One way to approach the [goal of model-agnosticism] is to require that the recoiling visible particles are produced by SM processes, not in the dark interaction. ISR meets this criteria. SM bosons are likely to be present in any BSM process, radiated from initial state partons at rates fixed by the SM. Because gluon ISR is far more prevalent than the other forms, the jet+\MET search is important particularly when the details of the dark interaction are unspecified.

%- many other searches with ISR+MET
%-- not the higher signal xsec
%-- interesting because they are lower xsec but also higher S/sqrt(B) 
%-- when the details of the dark interaction matter these can be enhanced (VVchichi) 
%-- even for a fixed model, if this is the subdominant channel, different (lower) trigger thresholds. looking for other ISR bosons or additional particles allows lower thresholds and more acceptance for signals 

%i like this part because motivation
Besides gluons, other particles can constitute visible-particle recoil.
In models where the recoil must arise from ISR, the rates for photon and electroweak boson radiation are much smaller than for gluon radiation.
Nevertheless, searches in \MET+photon and \MET+Z channels can play a complementary role alongside jet+\MET, with a smaller and different mix of backgrounds and different systematic uncertainties.
ATLAS and CMS have both performed searches in each channel.
With lower backgrounds, events can be recorded with lower kinematic thresholds, resulting in lower MET and visible \pt{} selections.
For example, the lowest \MET value probed by the Z+\MET search, where the Z decays into leptons~\cite{Sirunyan:2017qfc,Aaboud:2017bja}, is around 100 GeV, vs. 
200 GeV for the jet+\MET search~\cite{Sirunyan:2017jix}.

%this tells us about EFT and it's enough
These searches can play a much more powerful role when the recoil arises from the dark interaction itself rather than ISR.
In these cases, photon or vector boson recoil~\cite{Birkedal:2004xn,Petriello:2008pu,Carpenter:2012rg,Bell:2012rg}, rather than gluon recoil, may be the dominant signature.

% current song: https://open.spotify.com/track/11CTFD30oBVu5NPSgjLeyi. most of this album sounds like early 80's AC/DC
%i don't know this album enough
%i'm on "love and affection" soon catching up
In these searches, the event selection and the background estimation strategies generally mirror those of the jet+\MET search, but vary with the type of recoil, taking advantage of the special features of the signal.
In the photon+\MET searches~\cite{Aaboud:2017dor,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-014}, components of hadronic showers mis-identified as isolated photons are a sizable background to be rejected.
The searches with electroweak bosons decaying hadronically use jet substructure techniques~\cite{Sirunyan:2017jix,Aaboud:2016qgg} to recover information about boson mass and decay in events where the decay products from the high-\pt{} boson are collimated.
QCD jets will not present any substructure~\cite{Larkoski:2017jix}, while the decay products of vector bosons grouped into large-radius jets have a typical two-prong pattern from the hadronization of the quark-antiquark pair.

None of these searches yet observes a signal. The searches are not in general as sensitive as the jet+\MET search to models where the visible recoil arises from ISR, because of smaller signal acceptance and comparable signal to background ratio, but they can be remarkably competitive---after the jet+\MET searches, the photon+\MET searches are the next-to-most powerful probe.
%, with 95\% CL cross-section limit on invisible particle production constrained to be below 2.5 and 7~\fb depending on the \MET threshold~\cite{Aaboud:2017dor} ranging from 150 to 300 GeV, as opposed to numbers that are not comparable because they are for a different cross section / process.
However, these searches provide the most stringent limits on some models where the boson in question is directly involved in the dark interaction~\cite{Petrov:2013nia,Berlin:2014cfa}.% excluding EFT scales between 150 and 750 GeV for \mdm=100 GeV, assuming the maximal coupling value allowed by perturbativity.

\subsubsection{Search signatures including the Higgs boson}

% what we wrote above Besides the gluon, other particles can constitute the visible-particle recoil against invisible particle production. In the model-agnostic case discussed above, where the recoil arises from ISR, the rates for photon and electroweak boson radiation are much smaller than for gluon radiation

%- old to new: 
%- why we are so keen on doing monohiggs searches:
%
%-- because if DM couples to the Higgs this is the only way to see it 
%--- actually not because monojet in lagrangian too

%- study of higgs properties is a big focus of ATLAS and CMS
%- looking at the higgs in lots of ways
%-how we do Higgs searches: 
%-- like we did before, depending on the decay product, then we stick MET in it and kill backgrounds even further
%-- complementarity between bbar and gammagamma in the same way as before

One can also look for the newly-discovered Higgs boson in the recoil, but due to the heavy mass of the Higgs and the small heavy-flavor content of the proton, the rate of Higgs ISR is insignificant. 
Thus, searches for \MET+Higgs target dark interactions in which the Higgs is a direct participant, and therefore the interaction is closely tied to the Higgs sector. 
This is a feature of many models that extend the SM scalar sector, as described in Sec.~\cite{sec:BSMMediatorModels}. 

Dedicated searches for \MET+Higgs select Higgs events similar to the inclusive Higgs measurements, then require substantial \MET to reduce the backgrounds to the search.
In the Run-2 data, searches in the $H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-054,Aaboud:2017uak} and $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$~\cite{Aaboud:2017yqz} channels have been performed.
%why these channels and not the others

% other options are: WW and ZZ. these involve lots of additional complications. WW has a lot of different backgrounds, and ZZ is s
%do we say that? no space? i have "due to their relative experimental simplicity and/or high rates"
Searches in the $ZZ, WW$ and $\tau\tau$ channels are expected to contribute as well, once substantially more data is collected. 

% results / challenges
The \MET+$H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ searches~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-054,Aaboud:2017uak} benefit from their ability to precisely constrain the diphoton pair to the Higgs boson mass.
They are still statistically-limited.
The relatively low backgrounds allow probing for anomalous \MET as low as 50 GeV~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-054} .
The diphoton invariant mass is fitted in different signal categories, each optimized for different types of signal models. . 
%The SM background is estimated using a fit to the diphoton mass distribution, in events categorized
%according to their missing transverse momentum for CMS (50$<$\MET$<$130 GeV and \MET$>130$ GeV)
%or according to specifications optimised for different signal categories.%this is useless but the analysis is needlessly complicated  
The search for Higgs decays to two bottom quarks~\cite{Aaboud:2017yqz} requires \MET$>$150 GeV. All backgrounds except for the QCD background are estimated using MC simulation and constrained in dedicated control regions. 
It also employs jet substructure techniques for \MET$>$500 GeV to select boosted Higgs decays from a background of QCD processes.
The main systematic uncertainty for the lower \MET signal region is the modelling of the V+jets background, while higher \MET signal region is still statistically limited with the current dataset.

Absent signal, limits are set on the baryonic Higgs benchmark model outlined in Sec.~\ref{sub:simplifiedModels} with  \gq=1, \gdm=1, \ghZprimeZprime/$m_{Z}$=1, \sinthetab=0.3,

so the constraints are not yet directly comparable.}.

Higgs+\MET and Z+\MET searches are also sensitive to extended scalar sectors such as two Higgs doublets with a scalar or pseudoscalar mediator~\cite{Bauer:2017ota,Ipek:2014gua,No:2015xqa,Goncalves:2016iyg,Bell:2016ekl}.

%ttbar+MET
%reinterpretation of SUSY

%- what is important 
%-- one step beyond ISR searches: search for a specific production, constrains to be a specific type of model. 
%-- once we know what we're looking for, we can look more effectively
%-- more stuff: more jets + more specific (b jets not any old shit)
%-- add heavy flavour jets produced in association with the MET (coming either from mediator or from production)
%- aha it was susy all along
%- results on scalar and pseudoscalar: is it better than monojet?

%Generic searches employing one single additional type of object produced in association with \MET are powerful tools to probe simple models of invisible particles. 
% More complex models, however, bring more handles for discovery: steps in this direction can be taken with searches using 
In scalar- and pseudo-scalar-mediated simplified models, one can exploit the production mechanism in the search design. For instance, the mediator can be produced along with two top or bottom quarks, leading to a signature of \MET and multiple b-jets.

A recent ATLAS search in these channel~\cite{Aaboud:2017rzf} is optimized for both recoil consisting of semileptonic and fully hadronic top quark decays and recoil with one or two bottom quarks.
This signature is similar to that of third-generation quark superpartners and can be part of dedicated SUSY searches or used for reinterpretation~\cite{Aaboud:2017aeu,Sirunyan:2017leh}.
SUSY searches suppress most of the $t\bar{t}$ background, matching specific models to specific, low-background signal regions. 
Relative to these approaches, the search in Ref.~\cite{Aaboud:2017rzf} is less narrowly targeted at specific models, where control regions can be more reliably developed, instead relying more heavily on simulation.
The sensitivity of searches of \MET associated to top quarks is comparable for the two strategies. 

No excess is observed in any of these searches. 
For \IP masses of 1 GeV, color-neutral pseudo-scalar mediators of mass 20-50 GeV~\cite{Aaboud:2017aeu} and scalar mediators of masses up to 100 GeV~\cite{Sirunyan:2017leh} are excluded. %CD: it would be nice to find out why this difference in sensitivity? 
%The increased LHC dataset will allow these searches to be sensitive for other invisible particles masses. 
Signatures with $b\bar{b}$ pairs are less sensitive to models that do not explicitly privilege bottom quarks, but can set much higher limits on colored mediator masses in case of preferential couplings to bottom quarks~\cite{Agrawal:2014una}. 

%for invisible particle masses of 35 GeV and couplings corresponding to the , the lower limit on the scalar  
%if limits of about 1 TeV on the masses of colored scalar mediators coupling explicitly to bottom quarks~\cite{Agrawal:2014una} for invisible particle masses of 35 GeV.   
%Mediator masses for the b-flavored colored scalar 
%model discussed in~\cite{Agrawal:2014una} are excluded up to 1.1 TeV for invisible particles masses of 35 GeV. 

%Not spending more than one sentence on monotop, is that ok?
Other LHC searches in this category are those only including only one top or bottom quark (also called mono-top or mono-bottom searches)~\cite{Sirunyan:2018gka, Aad:2014wza}.
They place constraints on models that include singly-produced invisible particles candidates through flavor-changing neutral currents~\cite{Boucheneb:2014wza}.

%scalar and pseudoscalar mediators decaying into invisible particles (including the case of colored scalars), 
%The CMS search uses substructure techniques to identify events with boosted top quarks. 

%In SUSY-like searches, the dominant $t\bar{t}$ backgrounds
%are heavily suppressed using variables that combine visible and invisible
%mass~\cite{Lester:1999tx} targeting the model sought. 
%This step uses information that is model-dependent,
%but increases the sensitivity to specific processes. The remaining
%small backgrounds are estimated using simulation. 

%The dominant backgrounds in~\cite{Aaboud:2017rzf} are estimated separately
%using MC in each of the signal regions,
%and their normalization constrained using control regions in a simultaneous fit.
%The main uncertainties for these searches are, depending on the signal region,

%and uncertainties related to the identification of heavy flavor quarks. 

%The main backgrounds for these searches are single top or misidentified $t\bar{t}$ processes. 
%The search where the top quark decays hadronically

%- searching for decay chains of specific superpartners ending in neutralinos gives strategies to reject background
%- one more step towards full models, know more about the final state so we target it

So far, motivated by simple models, the \MET+X experimental searches discussed make few choices about the visible recoil particles, i.e. the species of a single particle, yet these already lead to a plethora of diverse signatures.

Models with more degrees of freedom may vastly expand the set of signatures to be explored.
Supersymmetry (SUSY) adds, along with invisible particles, many more ingredients: a full copy of the SM particle spectrum.
Each superpartner features particular decay chains that can be targeted to a greater or lesser degree, privileging either generality or maximal sensitivity. 
Compared to the generic searches above, SUSY searches general opt for a more specific decay topology and thus apply more stringent event selections based on the expected kinematic features, often using discriminating variables based on a combined mass of visible and invisible particles (see e.g.~\cite{Lester:1999tx}) to recover the ability to resolve various resonant decays.

SUSY has received much attention by ATLAS and CMS, and many searches for its particles, such as for squarks and gluinos, have a long history at earlier coliders as well.
In this section, we give a flavor of experimental results of more recent interest.

No SUSY search so far has produced a conclusive signal. However, given its multifarious signatures, it's difficult to make general statements about the current status, even for simplified models of SUSY. Perhaps the best one can say is that searches for strongly-produced superpartners constrain them for masses approaching a couple of TeV (see Fig.~\ref{fig:SUSYSummary_ew} and e.g.~\cite{Aaboud:2017bac,Sirunyan:2017yse}), for neutralino masses up to a TeV, and,
%https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMSPublic/PhysicsResultsSUS/T1tttt_limits_summary_cms_Moriond17.pdf
on the other hand, other processes are less constrained.
Direct production of weakly-coupled superpartners has a much smaller production rate, and hence the constraints on them are significantly weaker.
Third-generation squarks are generally only constrained to be at least several hundred GeV for neutralinos of similar masses, see e.g.~\cite{Sirunyan:2017wif,Aaboud:2016wna}.

But there are numerous exceptions to these blanket statements, even before one remembers that the masses exclusions shown in the figure only apply to specific slices of a multi-dimensional model parameter space.

Though LHC searches have mainly probed strongly-produced SUSY channels so far, searches for rare processes are now entering their prime.
With the data now collected, one can explore the electroweakino parameter space (see e.g.~\cite{Sirunyan:2018ubx,ATLAS:2017uun}). %, by combining several channels as in
Searches for gauge boson superpartners (gauginos) can reach approximately 1 TeV if the superpartners of SM leptons are light, and the search can benefit from a high leptonic branching ratio, whereas their reach is lower if their decays proceed through W and Z bosons. %can reach 600 GeV 
More luminosity also provides access to new regions of parameter space for specific signatures, e.g. ``compressed'' regions where small mass differences between superpartners lead the signals to lie buried in large backgrounds at low \MET~\cite{Aaboud:2017leg,Sirunyan:2017zss}.
Small mass differences can also suppress superpartner decays, resulting in long lifetimes. This can be exploited to study regions with a mass difference as low as 0.2 GeV for Higgsino models~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-019}.
Other mechanisms of decay suppression can do this as well (e.g. split SUSY~\cite{Sirunyan:2018vjp}). 

%%SUSY scans
%% Targeting a specific signature, such as a cascade decay in a specific simplified SUSY model, improves the ability to discover it. A narrower focus however trades generality for sensitivity, especially when interpreting results in terms of simplified models. 
%Designing and interpreting searches solely using simplified models may not capture the spectrum of possibilities
%given by full, theoretically well motivated models. 

Despite the unwieldy diversity SUSY signatures, a sufficiently specific model can provide a concrete framework on which to build an understanding of the combined effect of many experimental constraints. Ref.\cite{Conley:2010du}, continued in LHC experiments ~\cite{Aad:2015baa, Khachatryan:2016nvf}, uses the pMSSM to define a finite (though large) parameter space for whichthe  wealth of experimental constraints can be systematically evaluated.
Though this approach is not exhaustive, it can identify under-examined signatures for future emphasis.
Besides particle physics data, one may also identify the LSP with astrophysical DM to focus more specifically on regions compatible with a given cosmology, as in Ref.~\cite{Aaboud:2016wna}.
 %this is EW dark matter interpretations of ATLAS, maybe leave for comparisons section?

%Many tools (e.g. ) need to be combined to obtain these parameter scans. 
Collaborations such as GAMBIT~\cite{Athron:2017ard} and Mastercode~\cite{Bagnaschi:2017tru} have combined a variety of tools to aid in such efforts.
These codes encapsulate search results in statistical outputs which can be combined to construct global constraints for the models of interest. 
For example, one may compile the likelihood functions for the parameters of a SUSY model given the results from collider, direct, and indirect detection experiments.

%extreme range of experimental objects
% So far, we've only discussed signatures of invisible particle production where the 
Prompt decays produce visible recoil originating at the collision point, and thus it can be reconstructed using the techniques for which the experiments were designed.
The long-lived mediators described in Chapter~\ref{sec:LLPModels} present different experimental challenges. 
For short lifetimes, long-lived particles (LLPs) can decay inside the tracking detectors, appearing as displaced decay vertices. 
%need citation
Some SUSY decay chains lead to disappearing tracks, if the visible particles decay into the LSP and soft particles (see e.g.~\cite{Aaboud:2017mpt, CMS:2014gxa}). %(e.g. in split supersymmetry) 
%Another distinctive experimental signature of LLP is the "disappearing track", produced for example by SUSY models where a chargino
%with a short lifetime leaves a track in the inner detector which effectively disappears as it decays into a neutralino and a soft pion~\cite{Aaboud:2017mpt}.

These complications add yet another dimension of complexity to such searches, because observing the events may require dedicated triggers, reconstruction algorithms, and even detectors\cite{Ball:2016zrp,Chou:2016lxi}. 
%Nevertheless, these searches motivate specific, time-consuming detector and algorithms improvements, given that LHC searches didn't find any prompt new physics yet and given our ignorance of the dark sector and its interactions.

% don't know where this goes
%The LHC searches mentioned in this chapter, with the exception of compressed SUSY scenarios, 
%so far target prompt production of WIMP invisible particles or associated mediator particles at colliders. 
%The absence of a signal constrains these traditional WIMP models to have small cross-sections and high mass scales. 
%This is one of the reasons why less-accessible dark boson and dark scalar models, including mediators with masses from the MeV to the tens
%of GeV and with a range of potential lifetimes, are a target that is gaining interest by LHC searches. A similar consideration
%applies for SUSY scenarios that are hard to detect. 
%These signatures are particularly challenging for ATLAS and CMS, given that many of these possibilities escape
%conventional detection.

Searches at colliders use a variety of experimental signatures to target different types of dark bosons, such as dark vector or scalar bosons.
%Is it produced in DY collisions
An LHCb search for dimuon resonances~\cite{Aaij:2017rft} is sensitive to visible decays of vector mediators in the mass range between 10 and 70 GeV.%, avoiding the regions with SM resonances decaying to dimuons. 
This search can use the entire sample of dimuon decays delivered to LHCb, recorded at the full collision rate directly at the trigger level~\cite{Aaij:2016rxn}. 
Below 10 GeV, experiments at electron-positron colliders have searched for dilepton resonances or missing mass produced in association with ISR photons (see e.g.~\cite{Lees:2014xha,Lees:2017lec}). %visible and invisible
LHCb also searches dimuon events for scalar bosons with masses between 250 MeV and 4.7 GeV~\cite{Aaij:2016qsm}, for a range of lifetimes.
%
%Is it produced in association with Higgs?
Dark bosons can also arise in Higgs decays via a hidden-sector mechanism.
For example, the searches in~\cite{ATLAS:2016jza,CMS-PAS-HIG-16-035} look for exotic Higgs decays into collimated ''lepton-jets', constraining the decay rate to be below 10\% for a range of dark photon lifetimes. 
%Other signatures include pairs of di-muon resonances~\cite{Aad:2015sva,CMS-PAS-HIG-16-035}.
%There is a shitton of other stuff as well but we don't have time. 
%Drell-Yan dilepton production and electroweak precision observables are also sensitive to these models~\cite{Curtin:2014cca}, due to the mixing of the dark boson with the SM bosons. 
Ref.~\cite{Curtin:2014cca} provides a review of many possibilities.

%So far, we have discussed searches for invisible particles as a tool to probe the interaction between the SM and the dark sector. 
Dark interactions might also be probed without actually producing invisible particles.
For example, if the mediator particle can be produced via interactions with quarks, it may also decay into quarks. 
In this case, dijet and top-top resonance searches (see e.g. ~\cite{Liew:2016oon,Fairbairn:2016iuf,Chala:2015ama}) can constrain it.

Dijet resonance searches have been used routinely at hadron colliders to probe for new particles at newly-reached collision energies~\cite{Harris:2011bh}. 
They exploit an expected absence of features in the dijet invariant mass distribution to estimate the search background directly from a fit to the data, minimizing modelling and theory uncertainties.
This permits the observation of low-rate localized excesses (width/mass up to $\sim15$\%) from resonant dijet production~\cite{Aaboud:2017yvp,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-056}.
%% If the resonance is wide enough to appear as such r than , as in the case of vector and axial vector mediator models with couplings roughly above \gq$>$0.5~\footnote{This value
%% assumes that the new particle can decay only to quarks and invisible particles particles, with \gdm=1.0 and \mdm=1 GeV.}, the fitted background estimation may be biased by the presence of signal.
For wider signals, searches exploiting the scattering angle of dijet events can be used~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-046,Aaboud:2017yvp}. 

\input{TriggerSidebar}

%Where dijets lose sensitivity: low-mass 
At the LHC, typical dijet searches lose sensitivity at masses below about 1 TeV~\cite{An:2012ue,Dobrescu:2013coa}, where high rates force the experiments to discard a large fraction of the data in the trigger.
Some challenges of triggering are discussed in the Sidebar. 
One can reduce this threshold to 400 GeV~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-056,ATLAS:2016xiv} by recording much less information for these low-mass events~\cite{Aaij:2016rxn,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-056,Aaboud:2016leb}.
%due to the limited storage for QCD-like events at low invariant masses and be sensitive to mediators with masses

%mediator particles decaying democratically to different quark flavours or preferentially into heavy flavour quarks (as in the case for a scalar mediator).

Dilepton resonance searches also constraint mediator couplings to leptons~\cite{Aaboud:2017buh,Khachatryan:2016zqb}. 
For dielectron and dimuon searches, the main backgrounds arise from Drell-Yan processes. These are estimated with simulation corrected for NNLO effects and normalized to the Z boson yield in data.

Jets from the mediator decay are spatially separated for mediator masses above 250-300 GeV, where the $\gamma$ and gluon ISR + dijet channel constrains \gq$>$0.15-0.2.
Above 400 GeV, where searches with jets at the trigger level become available, they are the most sensitive, excluding \gq as low as 0.05.
Above a TeV, standard dijet resonance and angular searches constrain quark couplings from 0.1 to unity, up to 5 TeV.

Mixing between this mediator and the Z boson induces loop-level couplings to leptons. ATLAS and CMS use several sets of coupling benchmarks to illustrate how the experimental constraints depend on these unknown values.

\subsubsection{Comparison of sensitivity of visible and invisible LHC searches}
\label{sub:comparisonVisibleInvisible}

%- General thing
When searches can directly target specific, fully-visible signatures of a particular dark interaction, they can be powerful probes of that interaction, and in some cases (e.g., when the invisible particles are too heavy to be directly produced) are the only way to observe dark interactions at a collider. On the other hand, only \MET searches can observe the invisible particle production directly. Each type of search complements the others; nevertheless, piecing together searches in different channels requires a model---a model which may have many degrees of freedom---and so understanding precisely how these searches fit together can be challenging when little is known about dark interactions.

%- as an example for comparison of visible and invisible searches only covering a specific model, behold the summary plots
%- showing the relative power of these searches
%- mention DMWG (sidebox?) so the reader can get involved or have questions
To understand how this could work in practice, we again consider the case of (axial-)vector mediators, to which both jet+\MET and two-body resonance searches are sensitive. Even though the model is simple, its parameter space is four-dimensional (couplings, invisible particle mass, mediator mass), and different projections can be used to display results. The two-dimensional plane chosen to present results of visible and invisible particle searches, after discussion of the experimental and theory community interested in DM searches (called Dark Matter Working Group) is that of mediator mass and DM mass~\footnote{This is following the SUSY convention of presenting search results in the plane of neutralino mass against superpartner particle mass}, with fixed coupling values. The constraints from the different searches are displayed as excluded points in this plane, and the models parameters are clearly specified on the plots themselves.  

The coupling parameter values used as benchmarks have been selected considering the sensitivity of early Run-2 searches, precision constraints and general simplicity arguments, as well as the desire to showcase the complementarity of different LHC searches. The basic scenario for vector and axial vector searches is that of a mediator that only couples to quarks, with \gq=0.25, \gl=0. and \gdm=1. This is complemented by a scenario where couplings to quarks are reduced to 0.1, decreasing both production and visible decay, and scenarios where lepton couplings are present. Figure~\label{fig:sensitivityComparison} shows the results of LHC searches corresponding to two of these scenarios. The left-hand plot shows a leptophobic vector mediator with \gl=0, \gdm=1.0 and \gq=0.25, where dijet searches for visible decays of the mediator constrain both on-shell and off-shell region but are limited by data-taking constraints at masses above roughly 50 GeV, where \MET+X searches take over in the on-shell region. 
%An equivalent picture is drawn for the vector mediator, in the top right plot. The bottom right plot shows the case of an axial vector mediator with reduced quark couplings and equal lepton couplings (\gq=\gl=0.1 and \gdm=1.0), where 
The right plot shows the scenario of a vector mediator where both lepton and quark couplings are reduced with respect to the previous scenario, and lepton couplings are smaller than quark couplings (\gq=0.1, \gl=0.01, \gdm=1.0). 
The range of all regions constrained by dijet decays of the mediator is considerably reduced with respect to the scenarios with larger couplings. Searches for dilepton resonances cover a larger range of parameter space with respect to dijet resonances but are still limited at mediator masses below 100 GeV, where \MET+jet searches are still sensitive. 

%; the region constrained by from \MET+jet searches extends to lower invisible particles and mediator masses with respect to the case of the model with \gq=0.25 due to the reduced production rate.

Regions in a dark matter mass-mediator mass plane excluded at 95\% CL by a selection of ATLAS dark matter searches, for a vector mediator benchmark model with varying coupling scenarios. Top plots: \gq=0.25, \gl=0.0, \gdm=1.0, axial vector (left, separate search constraints) and vector mediator (right, combined search constraints), highlighting the sensitivity of visible searches in this scenario and the near-equivalence of the vector and axial vector as benchmark models for LHC searches. Bottom plots: \gq=0.1, \gl=0.1, \gdm=1.0 for an axial vector mediator (left) and \gq=0.1, \gl=0.01, \gdm=1.0 for a vector mediator (right), highlighting the sensitivity of the lepton searches and its dependence on the chosen coupling value. Dashed curves labeled "thermal relic" indicate combinations of dark matter and mediator mass that are consistent with a dark matter density of $\omega_c = 0.12 h^2$ and a standard thermal history, as computed in MadDM particles~\cite{Backovic:2015cra}.

Leptonic decays are absent at tree level. The results use 13 TeV data except for Phys. Rev. D91 052007 (2015). The exclusions from the ATLAS dijet searches are derived from the limits provided on Gaussian-shaped resonances following the procedure recommended by ATLAS in Appendix A of Phys. Rev. D91 052007 (2015) and in arXiv:1703.09127. Small fluctuations in the contour are a product of the dijet reinterpretation scheme. 
%To the left of the curve, annihilation processes described by the simplified model deplete ?c below 0.12 h2. A dotted curve indicates the kinematic threshold where the mediator can decay on-shell into dark matter. The exclusion regions, relic density contours, and unitarity curve are not applicable to other choices of coupling values or model.

%It is important to note that generic searches for new two-body resonances are by design sensitive to a broad range of theoretical benchmarks, 
%and as such they alone can offer little information on whether a discovery would imply in terms of invisible particles mediators.

These plots show that the relative sensitivity of visible and invisible searches is a model- and parameter-dependent statement. For $s-$channel simplified models where the couplings to SM are not negligible compared to the dark sector coupling, visible searches that more specifically target the mediator are more constraining than their invisible counterparts, in particular if the invisible particle is heavy and cannot be produced at the collider. 
%Invisible particle searches however would dominate whenever the 
%for invisible particles only dominate if the coupling to invisible particles is much larger than the coupling to quarks, and even then reducing \gq reduces the LHC production cross-section and therefore the overall sensitivity of \MET+X searches. When visible searches 
One advantage of searches for invisible particles is their sensitivity to models with very light mediators ($<$50 GeV) and light \mdm, since the reach of dijet and dilepton searches to low-mass resonances is still ultimately limited by data taking constraints. 
%In absence of a signal and within a specific model scenario, searches for mediator particle with visible decays provide constraints that are complementary to those of searches for invisible particles, in particular in the off-shell region 2\mdm $>$ \mmed where the mediator cannot decay to invisible particles directly but can still decay into much lighter SM particles such as leptons and quarks. 

[redundancy check?]
We finally remark again that none of these results rule out invisible particles with a given mass; they rule out {\it interactions} with invisible particles of that mass.

%Mention why we plot things in the mass-mass plane. 
%A sketch of the comparison of the sensitivity of searches for visible decays of vector and axial vector mediator models, and invisible particles 
%in the \minvisible particles vs \mmed plane is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sensitivityComparison}, fixing the couplings. The choice of plane and the scenarios chosen follow the choices of the Dark Matter Working Group~\cite{Albert:2017onk}, to illustrate the complementarity of different LHC searches for $s-$channel-mediated model of invisible particles and to convey the message that the sensitivity of LHC searches to simplified models of invisible particles depends both on model choice and parameter choice. 
%Mention why mass-mass? Because on-shell/off-shell regions clearly spelled out

%Couplings for vector and axial-vector mediated models 

%results are given in the \mdm particles, \mmed  plane fixing the couplings to \gq=0.25 and \gdm particles=1.0 for vector and axial vector mediated models, \gq=\gdm particles=1.0 for scalar and pseudoscalar models and \gdm particlesq=1.0 for colored scalar models. The simplified models employed by the experimental collaborations are known at NLO~\cite{Neubert:2015fka,Haisch:2013ata,Backovic:2015soa}.
