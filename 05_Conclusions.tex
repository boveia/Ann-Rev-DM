From 1960 to the Higgs discovery, colliders have been essential tools to discover fundamental particles.
A similar expectation existed for the LHC restart: SuperSymmetry, with a Dark Matter candidate and a rich spectrum of particles mirroring the SM, seemed on the verge of being discovered.
This has not been the case so far.
Nevertheless, it is at this point that searches for new particles at collider, complemented by next generation DD and ID experiment and increasingly precise maps of our universe, become most interesting.
With only loose guidance from theoretical arguments and current observations, we are prompted to hedge our bets by searching in an increasing number of signatures, benefitting from novel techniques motivated by the search for dark matter, and by the prospect that 99\? of the LHC data still has to be collected and analyzed.
We are optimistic for a discovery leading the way to future colliders and future experiments to investigate the particle nature of DM within the experimental reach of the LHC -- these are exciting times indeed.
