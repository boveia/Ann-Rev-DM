The \MET distribution of events, selected for high total hadronic energy and at least two jets with \pt{} $>$ 400 and 200 GeV, before (open circles) and after (filled circles) rejecting spurious \MET backgrounds~\cite{CMS-PAS-JME-16-004}. The predictions of MC simulations (shaded) are also shown.
Strong non-collision background suppression is vital to \MET+X analyses.
