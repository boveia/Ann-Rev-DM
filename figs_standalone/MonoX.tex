Sketches of (a) the DM--SM interaction in an effective field theory (EFT), (b) a corresponding simplified model mediated by a BSM particle (with additional radiation off one initial state quark) and (c) the same model where the mediator decays back into SM, with coupling constant for the mediator-quark-quark vertex, \gq, and constant for the mediator-DM vertex, \gdm.
