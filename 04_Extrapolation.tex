%Good sentence from DMF 

%One advantage of collider experiments lies in their ability to study and possibly characterize the mediator. A discovery of an anomalous E/T signature at the LHC would not uniquely imply discovery of dark matter, while at the same time e.g. discovery of an anomalous and annually-modulated signal in a direct-detection experiment would leave unanswered many questions about the nature of the interaction that could be resolved by the simultaneous discovery of a new mediator particle. Collider, direct, and indirect detection searches provide complementary ways to approach this problem [50], and it is in this spirit that much of our focus is on the mediator.
