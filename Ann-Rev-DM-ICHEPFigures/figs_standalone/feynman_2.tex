(\textit{a}) example of a process leading to a single top signature, proceeding through the coupling of an up quark $u$ and a top quark $t$ with a new vector boson, decaying to DM particles. 
(\textit{b}) example of a collider diagram from a co-annihilation model, where two DM particles are present in the final state (one denoted as $DM$ and the other to $X$). 
(\textit{c}) example of a diagram from a 2HDM process, with an interaction between a heavy Higgs boson $H$, a Standard Model $Z$ boson and a  pseudoscalar $a$ mediating the Standard Model-DM interaction. 
Abbreviations:\ SM, Standard Model; DM, dark matter; $g$, gluon; $u$, up quark; $t$, top quark; $V$, vector mediator; $X$, co-annihilating DM partner, $H$, Heavy Higgs boson; $a$, pseudoscalar boson.
