(\textit{a}) example of a process including a baryonic coupling between a vector mediator $Z'$ and a Standard Model Higgs boson. The $Z'$-Higgs coupling is denoted as \ghZprimeZprime. 
(\textit{b}) example of a process from a U(1) $Z'$ boson embedded in a 2HDM, where a vector $Z'$ decays to a pseudoscalar $A^0$ which in turn decays to DM particles. 
(\textit{c-d}) example of a simplified model process where the interaction is mediated by an intermediate scalar or pseudoscalar particle. In case \textit{(c)} the Standard Model-(pseudo)scalar interaction proceeds through a gluon loop as discussed in~\cite{Haisch:2013ata}, while in the case \textit{(d)} the pseudo(scalar) is produced in association with a pair of heavy flavor quarks. The coupling constants that are pre-factors to the Yukawa couplings in the model as explained in the text are denoted \gq for the mediator--quark--quark vertex, and \gdm for the mediator--DM vertex. 
Abbreviations:\ SM, Standard Model; DM, dark matter; $Z'$, vector mediator; $h$, SM Higgs boson, $S$, heavy scalar boson; $A^0/a$, pseudoscalar bosons, $g$, gluon; $t/b$, top/bottom quark.
