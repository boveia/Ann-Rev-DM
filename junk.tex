$qq \rightarrow H qq$, $qq/gg \rightarrow VH$, $gg \rightarrow Hg$ Higgs production modes. 
%CD: This section is just CMS for now. Need to add ATLAS, but also cut as we're using too much space for this:

In all cases, in addition to a requirement of sizable missing transverse momentum, auxiliary visible objects are used to select the events. 
%Loop-induced signals are important. 
%For more info on importance and calculation of loops: 1605.08039, but we run out of citations and space
The events are divided in exclusive categories targeting specific production modes. The associated boson (VH) searches target the decays of Z bosons to electrons, muons light or heavy flavour quarks, while the W bosons can decay into light-flavour jets. 
The $qq \rightarrow H qq$ production mode is dominated by Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) processes, where the Higgs boson is produced in association with two hadronic jets that have a large pseudorapidity ($\eta$)
%CD: assume eta?
separation in the detector, and a large invariant mass. This topology is used to select events and discriminate between signal and background. 
%The large QCD backgrounds are suppressed by requiring that the missing transverse momentum recoils against the jets in the event. 
%If the missing transverse momentum was in the direction of the jets, there would be a chance of it coming from mismeasured jets. %CD: hmmm written this in a rush
The jet+MET search, described in more detail in the next section, is reinterpreted for the $gg \rightarrow Hg$ mode. 


can be probed through direct observation  

only direct measurements of the Higgs width are feasible, because [reasons]

%Pre-LHC constraints on the invisible Higgs width are derived from measurements of the ZH production channel at LEP in searches for new neutral Higgs-like bosons, where only the visible decays of the Z are observed. This is a common procedure to select events in LHC invisible particles searches. 
- how do we measure it now: LHC 
-- ofuck a hadron collider: how?
---- try to measure directly -> most recent results that are upper bounds, highlight the ZH mode
---- use precision measurements
-- how to connect: Dobrescu: make a bunch of assumptions because you don't have total width, measure coupling ratios, not model-independent anymore (but ratios make it less model-dependent)

In the SM, the Z boson can decay to a neutrino-antineutrino pair, while the Higgs boson decays into a pair of Z bosons each decaying to neutrinos. Additional decays of the Z and Higgs boson to particles beyond the SM modify the properties of the vector boson, such as width and couplings. 

%%MonoH

\textbf{Invisible decays of the H boson} within the SM only contribute to less than 0.1\% of the total decay width. For this reason, an observation of even a small contribution to the Higgs width from invisible particles would signal the presence of new physics phenomena that could be linked to invisible particles if 2\minvisible particles $< m_H$~\footnote{For the case of heavier invisible particles particles, see Ref.~\cite{Djouadi:2011aa}.}. 



%CD: need a number! 
It is not feasible to directly or indirectly measure the total and partial Higgs widths at a hadron collider and then extract the invisible contribution as done for the Z at LEP, as some of the decays (e.g. gluons and lighter quarks) have too large a background to be measured, the experimental resolution even for leptonic decays is large compared to the intrinsic Higgs SM width, and the kinematics of the ZH process is not fully determined as in lepton colliders. %CD: this is ambiguous also because I am not sure I fully understand the first and third points completely - need AB's help, page 2 of Dobrescu/Lykken. 
%Lykken/Dobrescu, 1210.3342: Total theoretical SM width/mass for H125: 3.2 * 10^-5 MeV, due to small Yukawa of b quark and suppression of WW*. From rates and couplings,  can extract upper and lower limits on the exotic Higgs branching fractions, which come from the upper/lower limit on the total width. This paper ignores exp uncertainties. 
%Wagner Dark Side of the Higgs boson: omit because we don't care about non-SM Higgses
%The width can be extracted from the lineshape in the low-background channel $Z \rightarrow ZZ \rightarrow 4l$, assuming a SM width. This is what CMS has done. 
%If one does not want to assume the SM width, one can still extract the width
%above 190 GeV where the experimental resolution is better. 
%what we want to see is a larger total width with less normalization because of the invisible decays


%The upper limit on the invisible BR from Higgs decays is 25%. 
%ATLAS Abstract
%Direct searches for invisible Higgs boson decays in the vector-boson fusion and associated production of a Higgs boson with W/Z (Z ? ??, W/Z ? jj) modes are statistically combined to set an upper limit on the Higgs boson invisible branching ratio of 0.25. The use of the measured visible decay rates in a more general coupling fit improves the upper limit to 0.23, constraining a Higgs portal model of invisible particles.
%%Precision
Precision measurements of the Higgs boson properties and the comparison with SM theory also play a role in constraining the possible contributions to new physics, as decays into invisible particles would reduce the SM Higgs production and decay coupling strengths~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau,Englert:2011yb,Aad:2015pla}. 
%For the Higgs boson, the upper limit on the branching fraction to visible and/or invisible non-SM particles only using precision measurements is 34\%
%In case we want to say what limits these
%The main limitation for the measurement of the invisible width of the Higgs at the LHC is due to QCD uncertainties the Higgs production cross-section, which limits the sensitivity of these searches to roughly 10\% of the SM value. 




%CD: do we need to answer "what if not"? No one seems to care, but one could maybe think of using monojet off-shell (tiny tiny region) and precision constraints for the off-shell region too, a la dijet. Main point for the moment: DD covers this region so we don't have to. 















% leading to a measurement of the number of light neutrino families compatible with cosmology; if the partial widths of the decays into visible particles are subtracted from the total width, the invisible width can be measured to


%Searches for invisible particles at high-energy colliders are successful, since the Z boson branching fraction to light and weakly interacting particles is sizable. 
%The cross-section of Z to neutrinos at the LHC is [blah]. While included in the SM, these processes constitute a [testbed] and a background to further search for new invisible particles. 




%Higgs and Z portal models decay more in MET than they would do in the SM only
