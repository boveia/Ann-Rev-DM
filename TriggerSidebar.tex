%Sidebar (50 words minimum, 200 words maximum) briefly discussing a fascinating adjacent topic; 
%insert below Literature Cited section, but indicate near which section in text the sidebar should be typeset
%Consider swapping with the ERC text below?

%Trying to approximate 10 words per line
%Notes for improvement: 
%this is too long, needs sharpening. 
% the points i want to make are:
% higher thresholds are bad for mediator searches and also in general -> go TLA
% pileup increases MET thresholds -> get track info at the trigger level
%it needs a much clearer motivation: model X gives low mass. 
%probably that needs done in the text because space constraints, but then why using this box-thing (other than tidying things up)?

\section{Challenges for event triggering}

The LHC collides protons every 25 $\mathrm{ns}$ in nominal conditions. %(30 billion events per second) 
%This amount of data cannot be recorded in its entirety. %programmes or programs?
The decision to record collision events for further analysis is made by the trigger system~\cite{Smith:2016vcs,Aaboud:2016leb,Khachatryan:2016bia}. 
Its first hardware-based level uses partial detector information for fast decisions.% $\mathrm{\mu s}$.
Its second software-based level uses more refined algorithms and has access to further detector information.% to make a decision in $\mathrm{ms}$. 

\textbf{Triggering on low-\pt objects}
The trigger system records events above a certain threshold (e.g. leading jet \pt or event \MET), since energetic processes are likely to contain interesting features. 
Only a small fraction of events below these thresholds is recorded, penalizing signals with lower-energy signatures. 
%This penalizes searches with signals below these thresholds. 
However, if only final-state objects reconstructed by the trigger system are recorded, instead of full event information, the storage limitations can be overcome~\cite{Aaij:2016rxn,CMS-PAS-EXO-16-056,Aaboud:2016leb}. 
%unless non-standard data recording techniques are used.

\textbf{\textit{Pile-up} in trigger} 
Pile-up can add energy uncorrelated to the hard process of interest, increasing the event rate for a given trigger threshold: trigger \MET rates grow exponentially with the number of additional interactions. 
For this reason, increases in LHC instantaneous luminosity and dataset size come at the cost of increased thresholds.% due to increased numbers of simultaneous interactions. 
Dedicated pile-up suppression algorithms including partial tracking information are used in the trigger reconstruction~\cite{CMS:2014ata,ATLAS-CONF-2014-019}. ATLAS and CMS foresee dedicated hardware systems to obtain full tracking information in future LHC runs~\cite{Shochet:2013gaw,1748-0221-6-12-C12065}.
