%For future: mention future e+e- colliders in VH production.

Mention inclusive vs exclusive searches, monojet is the basic event selection then one selects more things on top of that.

%Moreover, the sensitivity hierarchy of \MET+X searches does not privilege the jet+\MET final state if there is a direct new physics coupling between a vector boson and the DM, as in the case of the EFT model mentioned in Section~\ref{sub:EFT}, or if the radiated object is a new particle~\cite{Autran:2015mfa}. 
%This latter signal motivates searches in the \MET+generic resonance final state CD: keep for later.
